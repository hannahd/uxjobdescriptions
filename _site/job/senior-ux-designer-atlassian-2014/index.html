<h1 class="job-meta">at <a href="/company/Atlassian">Atlassian</a> in San Francisco, CA from 2014</h1>

<p><p>Designers at Atlassian are responsible for the complete user experience, from early stage research and ideation, through implementation and iteration based on key success metrics. We’re dedicated to agile methodology and are believers in ‘lean’, which means we despise documentation for documentation’s sake. We are extremely self-driven, and do our very best at all times to validate assumptions about our users with various types of testing. <br />
<br />
We are not looking for designers who just want to concentrate on one skill in design, such as user research or visual design –  we need you to be eager to deliver across the entirety of the design process. We expect you to be really good in at least one design-focused skill. And while you’ll be so good at this that you can teach the rest of us what you know, you also have to be interested to improve in many other skills, and humble enough to always reach out to learn more.  <br />
<br />
Designers at Atlassian are either focused on a specific product like JIRA, a cross-product initiative such as registration and signup, or in a global team that maintains our design libraries and ensures we have the right techniques and research to be successful. <br />
<br />
The Senior UX Designer role will be responsible for ensuring our brand doesn’t stop at the doors. You will be working with our IT group on a variety of projects that are both internal and external customer facing, including creating useful experiences with our new personalization engine, building a community portal where customers can help each other, and making our internal tools and processes reflect our commitment to great user experience.<br />
We’re expecting you to bring 5+ years of hands-on professional experience as a UX Designer or Interaction Designer, ideally with SaaS or complex web-based enterprise applications. You will be working on projects that discover and resolve problems in Information Architecture and interaction design, and which require strong skills in facilitation and collaboration, relationship building, and driving for outcomes.  The projects will also require the ability to drive user research and do some visual design, based on an existing style guide and component library.</p>
</p>




<h2>Skills</h2>
<p><p>Atlassian values: We deeply believe in the Atlassian values. You’ll be surprised by how important these are, and by how often they will be quoted to you.<br />
Do your homework: When you work on something, it’s up to you to do the research. You need to be able to look at competitors, talk to people in the company, talk to our users and to people who’ve never heard of us before. All the time.<br />
Gut: At some point, you will be faced with decisions, and no amount of research will be able to help you. At such points, we believe it is absolutely valid to trust your gut. <br />
Simplify: We work on tools, and the best tools are simple. It doesn’t mean that they have to be boring, but they have to be easy to grasp and easy to use. So design, then simplify, and then simplify some more.<br />
Everybody can design: We do not have a monopoly on design, and we act accordingly. Many in Atlassian have a great sense of design, and instead of trying to beat them into submission, we educate them to be able to make better decisions for themselves. <br />
You make the call, you own it: If you feel a decision needs to be made, make it, and then see where it takes you. It’s important that you then own the decision and monitor it, and admit failure as enthusiastically as you claim victory.</p>
