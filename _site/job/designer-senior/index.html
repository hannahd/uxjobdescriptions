    <li>We believe in the power of stories.   And we love transforming data into insights.   We help people tell compelling stories with data - data of all sizes, shapes, and kind; through highly interactive, visually rich products that are used anytime, anywhere (desktop, web, mobile, and more…).

We are the design discipline within the Microsoft Data Platform Group, the second largest business within Microsoft.   We work as an integrated product design team with program management and engineering - to envision, create, craft and deliver next generation experiences for Microsoft’s data platform in the areas of databases, big data, and modern application platform in the cloud, based on deep understanding of what makes our users tick.

Our world-class product design teams are expanding, and we are looking for Senior UX Designers to own the design leadership and execution of key end to end experiences for our next generation end user tools.

This person must be an excellent hands on designer that can create exciting results on their own, and both participate in and lead a cross-functional team through a collaborative design process to deliver rapid prototypes, user stories, concept sketches, experience storyboards, information architecture, interaction design, visual design, motion design, design research and usability.

The senior UX designer needs to be competent in all of facets of the design process, and exceptionally talented and skilled in at least one major area (e.g. Visual and motion design, or Interaction and information architecture design).   Most importantly, the senior designer needs to have sufficient conviction in their designs to own the emotional dimensions of the product, ensuring that the experience delivered is ultimately emotionally irresistible.</li>
