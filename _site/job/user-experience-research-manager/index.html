    <li>E*TRADE is undergoing a transformation to become an insights-driven organization, and, as a result, we are building a high-performance research team that will partner with internal clients to embed research and insights into their business processes.
The UX Research team is a newly-formed organization responsible for guiding the development of digital experiences across platforms and technologies. The Research Manager will play a central role in achieving the team’s objectives and priorities.
The team operates as a consultative “internal supplier” that manages the majority of projects in-house, so the Research Manager will both design and execute effective UX research. Therefore, the successful candidate will have hands-on experience translating client requests into research objectives, using online research tools, be experienced user-testing interviewer, and have experience managing vendors.
We operate in a dynamic, fast-paced environment, so the Research Manager will also need strong project management skills, time management skills, and communication skills.</li>

Additionally, you also have access to <tt>page.name</tt>, which is the filename of the page, that is: index.html.
