    <li>Senior Architect User Experience</li>
    <li>Design and user experience are incredibly important at WalmartLabs. We look to the Senior User Experience Architect to envision how to help people save money and live better with Walmart, and to bring that vision to life.
User Experience Architects transform complex tasks into easy-to-use designs for our millions of customers around the world. To do this you’ll use your knowledge of the UX process (research, conceptual design, prototyping, testing) in collaboration with other architects, designers, content strategists, researchers, product managers and engineers.
You’ve created business and consumer product experiences for different channels and platforms, often working with senior UX leaders and managers to complete these projects.
A seasoned veteran, you can craft experiences for any channel or platform, and you are a leader in the creation of business and consumer product experiences. You can work without close supervision but you seek out and welcome feedback from senior UX leaders and managers.
You love to solve complex problems and work closely with others who feel the same, and your solutions merge with a larger structure to create a cohesive design ecosystem.
When you look at Walmart.com, you see multiple easy ways we could restructure our navigation, checkout flow, or page elements to make the experience easier and more delightful for our customer – and you’re excited to tell us about them.</li>

Additionally, you also have access to <tt>page.name</tt>, which is the filename of the page, that is: index.html.
