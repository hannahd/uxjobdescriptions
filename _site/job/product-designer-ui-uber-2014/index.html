<h1 class="job-meta">at <a href="/company/Uber">Uber</a> in San Francisco, CA from 2014</h1>

<p><p>Uber has already found strong product/market fit with its world-changing service.  But it is absolutely day one for us. We’re seeking a small group of unbelievably talented and thoughtful designers to define and execute against a giant vision that builds upon what Uber has brought to the world so far.  <br />
If you have the right stuff to join the Uber Experience Design team, you’ll work among design oriented engineers, product managers and some of the best designers in a fast-paced, rapidly growing, hybrid (technology/operations) environment.<br />
We are highly user-centric and we deeply believe we can innovate our way out of any box.  The role demands great execution, bold innovation, obsession with quality, fearlessness and optimism to be inspired by the unknown and never settle, solving problems with creativity while keeping the user in mind and ambition to take projects to the finish line.</p>
</p>




<h2>Skills</h2>
<p><p>THE DETAILS MATTER TO YOU.<br />
You’ve spent your career slaving over letter spacing and corner rounding. You can’t not bump that object 2px to the left just to get it right. You are a walking encyclopedia of microinteractions in use (on mobile, web, desktop, etc), and have nuanced views on how to make many of them even better.<br />
 <br />
YOU DO MORE THAN JUST MAKE IT PRETTY.<br />
You design beautiful UI, and you realize beauty only gets you so far. You actively participate in all aspects of the product design process. You have opinions beyond just the look and feel. You are deeply passionate about how the pieces fit together to create the best experience.<br />
 <br />
 <br />
YOU ARE INCREDIBLY PRODUCTIVE.<br />
You deliver twice the quality in half the time. You mastered the Creative Suite years ago. You geek out on keyboard shortcuts, Photoshop actions, and the newest prototyping tools. You constantly strive to optimize your workflow, increase your output, and become a more efficient and effective designer.<br />
 <br />
YOU’VE SHIPPED BEST-IN-CLASS PRODUCTS.<br />
You’ve weathered release cycles and know what details matter at each stage, you document and motivate engineers to get the fit and finish right. You can share several shining examples of real work you’ve shipped, and what you learned along the way.<br />
 <br />
YOU ARE A STORYTELLER.<br />
You know that design alone is not enough to make a product successful. You craft stories within the product to make the experience more relevant and human. You tell stories to teammates to sell your ideas, provide context, and make design more compelling.<br />
 <br />
YOU CAN THINK AND TALK ABOUT THE BOTTOM LINE.<br />
Analytics don’t scare you, and you know which features can act as force multipliers on your company’s business model.<br />
 <br />
PROTOTYPING IS A KEY PART OF YOUR TOOLSET.<br />
You’ve prototyped on multiple platforms. You’ve made last-minute tweaks between user studies. You know how to be all kinds of quick and dirty, but dream of better prototyping tools.<br />
 <br />
CROSS-PLATFORM IS YOUR STYLE.<br />
Hopefully you’ve shipped something across several platforms. You know what translates from desktop and what doesn’t, or why you’d opt for one solution for iOS and another on Android.</p>
