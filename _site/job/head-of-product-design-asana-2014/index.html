<h1 class="job-meta">at <a href="/company/Asana">Asana</a> in San Francisco, CA from 2014</h1>

<p><p>We’re looking for the people manager who will design Asana’s design organization and create a great experience for the individual contributors. This person will help make both our design team and our product a dream to work in.<br />
<br />
Asana is going after a huge mission – to help humanity thrive by enabling all teams to work together effortlessly. We’re on a very strong trajectory toward getting there, with organizations like Dropbox, Airbnb, Uber, SimpleHuman, Nest, CERN, the NYC Department of Education, and tens of thousands of others already running their internal communication on Asana. We believe the person who takes this role will end up having a substantial impact on designing the future how teams of humans work together.<br />
<br />
We currently have a team of 7 very talented product designers. What we need is an experienced design leader who can harness that talent and take the product to the next level. Ultimately, great user experience is Asana’s raison d’etre.<br />
<br />
Opportunities to make things better<br />
<br />
This is an opportunity to come into a product and a team that already have traction solving important problems for well-respected customers, and make the product and team far better than they are today.<br />
<br />
The User Experience. While we think there’s no other teamwork product with this much power that’s this simple, we believe that great design leadership will help us express that power in a form that is vastly easier for customers to grok – and more beautiful and delightful.<br />
<br />
On the one hand, customers today love how Asana helps them accomplish more than they could before. They tell us they appreciate that workflows are efficient, interactions are optimized, and the interface affords them a ton of organizational power. On the other hand, many users find Asana’s UI too complicated (and rightfully so), especially as we move further into the mainstream of knowledge workers. We’re excited about the huge opportunity this presents.<br />
<br />
The Team. The Asana design team has a strong bench of raw design talent, with ICs of varying levels of experience. A great design leader can provide the mentorship necessary to elevate each IC to a world-class crafts[wo]man. You will also develop the organization and its processes so that the whole is much more than the sum of its parts, producing a user experience that feels born from a single consistent perspective.</p>
</p>


<h2>Responsibilities</h2>
<p><p>Coaching all the designers on the team to become the best they can be.<br />
Making the design team as efficient and effective as possible. Scaling processes and ensuring we operate as a well-oiled machine.<br />
Build organizational clarity around high-level design vision, and working with the team to translate it into action.<br />
Cultivating an environment and culture that is a paradise for designers to work in.<br />
People management, including:<br />
Providing personal-growth and career-development mentorship.<br />
Shepherding designer:project allocation, based on a deep understanding of each designer’s strengths and aspirations.<br />
Developing agreement around larger-scale design initiatives, assessing tradeoffs in approaches, and shepherding executing.<br />
Representing design priorities within the company. Serving as a liaison to other departments.<br />
Recruiting new members of the team, and scaling the organization as appropriate to accommodate.</p>
</p>





<h2>Minimum Qualifications</h2>
<p><p>2+ years experience managing a design team that includes both junior and senior designers.<br />
Strong leadership, management, coaching, communication, and organizational skills.<br />
5+ years experience as a professional designer.<br />
Experience balancing fast iteration with consistency, resulting in a beautiful product that doesn’t take a ton of time to ship things.<br /></p>
</p>



<h2>Preferred Qualifications</h2>
<p><p>Experience growing a team from &lt;10 reports to 30+ reports.<br />
Strong presence in the external design community.</p>
