<h1 class="job-meta">at <a href="/company/Groupon">Groupon</a> in San Francisco, CA from 2014</h1>

<p><p>Excited to change the face of local commerce? To communicate new tools to merchants that will allow them to compete with online and big box retail, and reduce the friction in their interactions with customers? This is exactly what design at Groupon Merchant OS does. We cultivate deep empathy for these users, and translate this understanding into inventive, effective and delightful visual stories that cross channels and devices (email, web, mobile, and tablet).<br />
<br />
Experience working with international design departments and integrating design guidelines across departments, platforms, teams!<br />
<br /></p>
</p>


<h2>Responsibilities</h2>
<p><p>Visual Design for all online initiatives and printed communication, where attention to detail and love for craftsmanship is celebrated. You avoid derivative solutions, you are not happy being me-too, you push the envelope. You think systems (not one-offs). Your work is modular, scalable. You wield both the art and science of design into actionable, replicable solutions. You think of graphic design as a living interaction, not static output.<br />
<br />
Any thoughts on Brand Experience Patterns? A brand API?: Did we mention we are reinventing interaction between Merchants, their business insights and their consumer interactions? Come up with unique and innovative new ways of optimizing communication channels and brand deployment!<br />
<br />
Work alongside Marketing folks, Social Community managers, Creative Directors, even Product Designers, UX architects and User Researchers. Be respected and sought-after by all.<br />
<br />
Sketching, concept generation, and other ideation exercises to push the boundaries of what we design.<br />
<br />
Prototypes, workflows, wireframes, and other elements of making explicit the functional and systems core of a product’s design, across all relevant channels and devices<br />
<br />
Craft prototypes of proposed website designs. If it moves, if it behaves… we get faster and closer to the truth when evangelizing internally and testing on our audience<br />
<br />
Contribute ideas to improve existing products, both in and outside personal expertise<br />
<br />
Work closely with product managers and engineers to complete projects</p>
</p>





<h2>Minimum Qualifications</h2>
<p><p>First and foremost, applicants should be awesome, empathetic design thinkers who can engage in an end-to-end experience, from vision to production.<br />
<br />
At least 2-4 years experience as a visual designer within a product company<br />
<br />
Strong portfolio featuring examples of both graphic design and interaction work. Any experience working on the mobile and/or devices industry is highly appreciated<br />
<br />
A strong, clean visual design sense, valuing innovation, beautiful simplicity, and smart consistency (cats optional)<br />
<br />
Expertise on the whole Adobe suite is assumed… but any skills on Framer, Sketch, Mirror and other prototyping tools will be something we look for.<br />
<br />
Great design communication skills; able to tell the story of a design from end to end<br />
<br />
Solid grounding in fundamentals of typography, color, layout, content hierarchy<br />
<br />
Ability to set (and/or follow) interface guidelines, style guides, and best practices when designing for new platforms, and an ability to intelligently challenge and improve them when necessary<br />
<br />
Proven experience designing for the modern, responsive web<br />
<br />
Comfort working in fast-moving, agile development environments with sometimes ambiguous and changing goals<br />
<br />
Healthy sense of humor (see point above)<br />
<br />
Ability to think about high-level product vision and contribute a vision of a fantastic user experiences, is a welcome skill<br />
<br />
A link to personal website or web portfolio.</p>
</p>



<h2>Preferred Qualifications</h2>
<p><p>Familiarity with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the technologies that you’re designing for is kinda useful, a lot, actually.<br />
<br />
Experience with versioning, SVN, or preferably Git… would be unbelievably awesome (but not required, we are just reaching for the gold here)<br />
<br />
Experience with e-commerce and local business<br />
<br />
Experience working with Ruby on Rails and jQuery? That is just icing-on-the-cake! (you are a monster by the way)<br />
<br />
Familiarity with quantitative testing methodologies: A/B testing, log analysis, and other forms of data-driven design… as that is what invariably happens to your output!</p>
