    <li>Sr. Engineering Project Manager</li>
    <li>Project Managers on the iTunes Store are responsible for shipping new features. We're looking for people with proven track records of shipping complex, customer-facing projects under demanding timelines. Bonus points for new product introductions.  This is a hands-on position where the Project Manager will be involved in requirements analysis, functional and technical design discussions, testing, proof-of-concept, working with partners, and more. This is not a task-based job; you will be responsible for successful outcomes and delivery.  Strong fundamentals are a must, but you have more. You take responsibility; you feel a personal stake in the product you ship; you communicate responsibilities and scope clearly; you value integrity; you manage conflict; you need to know how things work; you work for the success of the entire PM team; you thrive in uncertainty and strive to bring order to it; you have deep wisdom and judgement; you keep your eye on the ball; you build strong relationships; you are aware of politics but do not get mired in them; you are constantly looking to improve yourself and your team; you're prescient; and you ship code which millions of customers will use.</li>
</ul>

Additionally, you also have access to <tt>page.name</tt>, which is the filename of the page, that is: index.html.
