<h1 class="job-meta">at <a href="https://hannahd.github.io/uxjobdescriptions/company/Spotify">Spotify</a> in Stockholm, Sweden from 2/21/2021</h1>

<p><p>We are looking for an experienced Design Manager to join our Platform Developer Experience - Spotify’s division that is dedicated to building out world class developer tools and Client Platform - Spotify’s division that is focused on mobile and client engineers. <br />
<br />
While we are focused on building out internal tools and infrastructure, we take a human-centric product approach where UX and design is a critical component. In this role you will have the opportunity to interact with many roles and functions across Spotify and together with our product teams work to improve the platform user experience.<br /></p>
</p>


<h2>Responsibilities</h2>
<p><p>Co-lead a team of designers working on different complex problems and B2B software.<br />
 Guide the design team through their day to day work while also keeping an eye on the bigger picture and driving the overall vision.<br />
Provide context, support and guidance as the team works toward our business objectives — you will inspire, not merely direct.<br />
Identify and grow talent within the design team, setting them up for success through mentorship and coaching.<br />
Collaborate closely with product, insights and tech counterparts to shape a vision for the platform.<br />
Creatively integrate and build on top of Backstage. <br />
You are willing to get hands-on, partnering closely with other designers and/or engineering teams. <br /></p>
</p>



<h2>Skills</h2>
<p><p>You have 3+ years practical management experience with designers in an agile product development environment, and you are able to foster and grow the culture in cross-functional teams through advocacy.<br />
You’re comfortable working with partners to create holistic solutions involving both internal and external technology and products.<br />
You are a leader with practical design chops you don’t mind dusting off from time-to-time. You’ve shipped many consumer products over the years, and understand what it takes to create awesome, consumer-oriented experiences.<br />
You’re a fantastic communicator and storyteller.<br />
You are people-focused and have the right balance of gut, pragmatic intuition and a user and data-focused design mentality. You are constantly looking to hone your team’s instincts through a variety of inputs – including trend analysis, benchmarks, feedback and data insight.<br />
You are hungry to learn and evolve in all things. From leadership skills to design craft to process to industry and market trends — you never stop pushing into the next big challenge and fit right in to our growth-focused culture.<br />
You thrive in coaching teams to balance short term needs while keeping an eye on and contributing to long term strategic goals.<br />
You are comfortable with balancing the needs of the larger design ecosystem with the local goals of your mission.<br />
You are able to provide a brief explanation in your application of why you are excellent for this role, while highlighting a portfolio of work that represents who you are as a designer and leader. Applications without a portfolio are unlikely to be considered.</p>
