<h1 class="job-meta">at <a href="/company/Skype">Skype</a> in Redmond, WA from 2014</h1>

<p><p>At Skype, designers are responsible and accountable for delivering great and relevant products to market by collaborating with product managers to create new, innovative products and by working directly with engineering to build those products. The goal? Maintain our market leadership, continue to disrupt our competitors and have an impact on the lives of millions of people by improving one of the most loved products in the world.<br />
<br />
Our design team is a highly collaborative group of user researchers and product and visual designers. We value creativity, open idea sharing, and having fun while we work. Most of all, we’re motivated by our millions of users. We want them to love our products. <br />
<br />
We are looking for designers who know how to think and design new experiences on emerging hardware and software platforms. We are looking for an individual who loves new technologies and can design to make the most of them. <br />
You will be responsible for facilitating the delivery of world-class designs from conception through completion by deeply collaborating with engineering, product management and other design teams. You will need to provide design directions and be able to communicate your ideas using a wide variety of methods-from sketches to fully rendered designs. <br />
<br />
You will be designing E2E experiences involving new hardware; We are specifically looking for a designer with experience in NUI technologies- voice, touch, gesture, etc. Strong visualization skills are required. Prototyping is a huge plus.</p>
</p>


<h2>Responsibilities</h2>
<p><p>Deliver world-class interaction designs from initial concept through to launch and evaluation of success.<br />
  Solve complex problems in core interactions and interfaces that will be adopted across the portfolio from mobile clients to large screens.<br />
  Produce design visualizations to help everyone understand what the best experience should be: storyboards, flows, wireframes, prototypes, and vision pieces.   <br />
  You can handle complex design problems and have a proven ability to create sophisticated and elegant solutions. <br />
  You have outstanding communication/presentation skills to tell your design stories to fellow designers, developers, and product management.<br />
  Self-motivated and driven to get the details right.<br />
  You’re able to work well with others and don’t have an ego that gets in the way.<br />
  Good sense of humour.</p>
</p>



<h2>Skills</h2>

  Proficiency in design tools such as Creative Suite, 3D design tools, Flash, etc. Ability to create high-res visualizations and prototypes. <br />
  This is not a visual design role, but we do expect a high degree of visual literacy for the purpose of producing suitably impressive documentation and ideation materials. <br />
  Industrial design experience is highly desirable<br />
  A BA or advanced design degree, related degree or equivalent experience.<br />
  Minimum 4 years in a user experience role for software products<br /></p>
