<p><p>Facebook is looking for Research Leaders with excellent research, communication and people management skills. Facebook is a diverse product used by over a billion people – it’s ripe for research. But figuring out the right research, the appropriate involvement, and the ideal touch points is a delicate balance, especially in a process-averse culture. What makes a good candidate?

You must be a strong voice in design and strategic discussions and an overall expert in the relationship between research, design, marketing and product. You must build strong relationships with other research teams at Facebook to ensure a cohesive and cross-functional vision for Research at Facebook.<br /></p>
