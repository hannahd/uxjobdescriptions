<h1 class="job-meta">at <a href="/company/Spotify">Spotify</a> in New York, NY from 2/21/2021</h1>

<p><p>Join our team to create experiences and tools that help brands and businesses to tell their stories and reach Spotify listeners. In this role, you’ll help build and evolve Spotify Ad Studio, our self-service advertising tool.  <br />
<br />
You’ll join a cross-functional group working on key strategic and growth efforts for Spotify – looking critically at how we build tools for advertisers, creating best-in-class experiences that grow and thrive within the Spotify ecosystem. We are looking for someone passionate about using their craft to help us create strategies and beautifully designed products. How do we deliver valuable, understandable experiences that provide real value to advertisers in the context of Spotify? How do we balance what’s good for business and our advertisers, with the need to champion, empower, and protect our listeners and the content they come to listen to? How do you empower advertisers of all kinds to become creators themselves?</p>
</p>


<h2>Responsibilities</h2>
<p><p>Write clear, consistent, concise user-interface content, emails, notifications, and product tours at all stages of the advertiser journey.<br />
Evolve our holistic content strategy for our advertising product experience.<br />
Champion a cohesive brand story for our advertiser experiences and tools.<br />
Collaborate with designers, researchers, prototypers, product managers, and engineers to deliver compelling UX solutions.<br />
Act as a subject matter authority who can present and rationalize work to partners.<br />
Use data and research to evaluate content’s impact.<br />
Maintain and document evolving content, brand, and voice/tone standards.<br />
Effectively balance multiple projects and deadlines.<br />
Help lead projects alongside your design and cross-functional partners, across the entire user journey and ongoing product lifecycle. <br />
Consider problems from multiple angles. You’ll produce an array of divergent approaches informed by a confluence of user needs, business objectives and technical capabilities. <br />
Be autonomous. You’ll help promote an understanding for your discipline and the value it brings to the product development process. You’ll provide teams with the methods, process and solutions needed to execute strategy. You’ll drive progress through obstacles by building alignment and making decisions - taking responsibility for every last detail, every step of the way.</p>
</p>



<h2>Skills</h2>
<p><p>You have at least 5 years of experience writing or editing content for the web and mobile experiences, as a UX writer, information architect, content strategist, or similar. Experience designing for B2B and SaaS tools are big pluses.<br />
Bonus if you have experience writing for self-serve platforms or advertising tools.<br />
You’re a great communicator. <br />
You’re a systems-thinker who loves to create simple and elegant experiences for complex products.<br />
You have the skills to help set up frameworks and brainstorm initial design concepts.<br />
You often find yourself operating at the intersection of content strategy, UX thinking and copy. <br />
You also have the ability to mentor others to deliver work, and help bring strategy to life.<br />
You are a holistic user experience thinker that considers every facet of the user journey. <br />
You enjoy solving problems, big and small, for all kinds of users. You are constantly looking to hone your executions through user feedback. <br />
You’re an expert in your craft, but you recognize the importance of setting aside the time and space to learn and grow.<br />
You have a portfolio or case studies that you can share with us, to help us learn how you think and practice your craft.</p>
