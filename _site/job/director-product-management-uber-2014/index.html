<h1 class="job-meta">at <a href="/company/Uber">Uber</a> in San Francisco, CA from 2014</h1>

<p><p>If you have the right stuff to join the Uber Product team, you’ll work among star engineers, designers and product managers in a fast-paced, rapidly growing, hybrid technology/operations environment.  We are highly customer-centric and we deeply believe we can innovate our way out of any box.  The role demands exceptional management and people leadership skills, great technical depth, principled thinking, well honed product judgment, a stubborn refusal to settle, bold innovation, a high design bar and a mentality of starting with the customer and working backwards.</p>
</p>


<h2>Responsibilities</h2>
<p><p>Internalize and deeply understand Uber’s mission and strategies; play key role in translating into product strategy<br />
Manage, coach and lead a team of highly technical Product Managers and, later (as the team continues to scale), Group Product Managers.  Ensure strong team dynamics, team + individual team member performance, growth and #superpumpedness.  <br />
Distill vision and strategy for the team, and ensure coherence across teams and initiatives.<br />
Relentlessly recruit the best product, engineering and design talent in the industry<br />
Be in the details.  Know your team’s work in depth; get your hands dirty a lot.<br />
Interface with other functional areas (Engineering, Business Development, Operations, Legal, etc.) to ensure efficient and productive working relationships.<br />
Lead by example.  Be incredibly truth-seeking and finger-tippy with data, set a high bar for the team to think boldly and creatively and then to funnel that energy into concrete products and execution plans, move fast, be biased toward action.<br />
Drive team to set and achieve qualitative objectives and quantitative goals with their Program teams<br />
Contribute materially to innovation, definition, deliverables planning (roadmap), design and go-to-market planning of entirely new Uber products and product features to deliver against team and company goals.  <br />
Monitor and measure launched products and feed learnings back into product development process.<br />
Clearly communicate product plans, benefits and results, as appropriate, to a spectrum of audiences, from internal stakeholders to all Uber employees to customers.</p>
</p>



<h2>Skills</h2>
<p><p>A computer science undergraduate degree or equivalent plus hands-on software engineering experience.  Technical understanding must go from the highest abstractions down to the metal.<br />
10+ years experience delivering highly successful and innovative consumer Internet products with your fingerprints all over them - you’re extremely proud of what you’ve accomplished<br />
5+ years team management experience, leading teams through many successful product cycles<br />
Stellar design instincts and product taste<br />
A high bar across the board - from your own contributions to the people you work with to the products you work on.<br />
A “driver” personality - biased toward action, great collaborator and master disambiguator/simplifier - constantly pushing toward clarity and delivery.<br />
Grittiness.  You never hesitate to roll up your sleeves and tackle something hands-on, you persevere when others fall away.<br />
Finger-tippiness with data:  you just go get the data you need with no muss/fuss and can whip it into an insightful story with no help.  You know how to leverage data to make decisions without getting stuck in analysis paralysis.<br />
Customer-centricity - examples from your past of tough product challenges that you powered through because you were unwilling to make your problems your customers’ problems.<br />
True passion for Uber’s mission and the company’s hybrid technology / operations nature.<br />
A never-ending desire to grow and learn.</p>
