    <li>Sr. Manager, User Experience Design</li>
    <li>Are you excited about the opportunity to delight millions of customers worldwide with a truly personalized shopping experience on any device? Are you passionate about brainstorming, ideating, and designing solutions to customer problems at scale? Have you taught yourself to code, dabbled in APIs, or researched recommender systems just because you wanted to explore building new innovative user experiences? This role is for you!

You will play a vital role in driving the future of a world-class e-commerce recommendation engine. You will have a rare knack for finding the intersection between bleeding edge technology and effortless user experiences. You are customer-obsessed, detail-oriented and able to handle multiple projects in a fast-paced environment. You are skilled in using data to make decisions and comfortable working with highly technical teams.

Recommender systems at other companies focus on only one vertical - just movies, just music or just people (you may know)... At Amazon, we build recommender systems for all product categories - E-Books, Music, Movies, Games, Clothing, Electronics, Consumables, Home and Garden and Sports (to name a few). Ever spent time thinking about how to build a great recommender for Clothing? How about Mobile Apps? What about Music?

What could a Personalized Search experience on Amazon look like? How could a customer leverage their social network to help them complete their shopping mission? How could we use Machine Learning to anticipate a customer’s needs before they do? How can we utilize the rich structure of Amazon's catalog to build semantic recommendations? How can we leverage our algorithms to build amazing tablet, mobile, TV and desktop experiences?

These are all the problems we tackle every day. If you think you have answers to these questions and many others that aren't included here, then we want to talk to you.

We are seeking a bold, forward thinking Manager of User Experience Design to lead a high-performing team of Interaction Designers and Visual Designers in the journey to shape how consumers access and experience Amazon’s Search across web, mobile, tablet and native apps offerings.

The User Experience Design Leader would have responsibility for leading a design team to innovate and deliver the overall user experience with creative design thinking, data and customer insights.</li>
