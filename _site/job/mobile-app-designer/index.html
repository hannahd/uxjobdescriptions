    <li>Our guiding principle is that by helping our users we help our business. As a designer in our mobile team you'll be a key part of the idea generation process, working in a small startup-like group which takes full ownership of their part of our platform. You'll be working on the iterative improvements we make as part of our high-speed release cycles, as well as looking ahead and conceptualizing broader changes our mobile app offers across all major platforms. You'll work with developers, product owners, copywriters and user researchers to conceive, analyse & test your ideas.

Additionally, you also have access to <tt>page.name</tt>, which is the filename of the page, that is: index.html.
