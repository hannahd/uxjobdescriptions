<h1 class="job-meta">at <a href="/company/Spotify">Spotify</a> in New York, NY from 2/21/2021</h1>

<p><p>We’re searching for a Product Designer to join our New York-based design team working on our consumer-focused advertising experience and podcast monetization strategies, partnering closely with the technology and product teams on our key initiatives. Someone who is enthusiastic about developing strategies based on insights from real people, has the proficiency in their craft to turn these insights into appealingly designed products (both interactions and visuals) and encourages the organization by showing/prototyping what is possible before it is built. Are you someone who is interested in examining how the Podcast listening experience and advertising exist in harmony, both helping brands to reach listeners and propelling podcast creators to make a living off of their art? Come join us!<br /></p>
</p>


<h2>Responsibilities</h2>
<p><p>Create compelling multimodal experiences across the Spotify ecosystem for ads and promotions, exploring new ways for our listeners to engage that span different personas, contexts and devices.<br />
Work with peers to run experiments and develop processes in a fast-paced environment to change behaviors and drive revenue growth.<br />
Collaborate with other podcast-focused teams and messaging teams to ensure we are using harmonious solutions and consistent patterns that spark engagement, while broadening the understanding of our consumers and their listening habits.<br />
Think outside of the box to build and execute on broad ideas, turning them into exciting, innovative, and viable solutions for the business that drive revenue.<br />
Work cross-functionally to drive a project forward by planning and breaking down open-ended opportunities into impactful next steps.<br />
Use insights to inform your designs to balance listener value and performance. You have a solid understanding of experimentation frameworks.<br />
Produce an array of divergent, human-focused approaches advised by user needs, business objectives and technical capabilities.</p>
</p>



<h2>Skills</h2>
<p><p>3-5+ years experience delivering extraordinary design as a UX designer, information architect, interaction designer or similar. Mobile experience is a requirement.<br />
You care about communication and employ storytelling to paint a picture, build common understanding, set up frameworks and brainstorm initial design concepts.<br />
A conceptual and human-centered problem solver. Someone who seeks to understand people’s needs, motivations and behaviors – in order to translate them into impactful results.<br />
Your head is in the clouds while your feet are on the ground. You love thinking big, and at the same time, you know when to apply pixel-perfect attention to detail.<br />
Care deeply about the impact of your work. Have experience tracking usage of the things you build, and using the data collected to verify its efficiency.<br />
An excellent teammate, partner and facilitator.<br />
Can provide an online portfolio, or PDF to share to help us learn about how you think and practice your craft. Please be sure to provide any necessary passwords, we cannot advance your application without them.<br />
Please provide a brief explanation in your application of why you are excellent for this role, while highlighting your portfolio.</p>
