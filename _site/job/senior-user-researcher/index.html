    <li>Your curiosity is insatiable. Your brain craves challenges. You'll take things apart and blow stuff up as much as you enjoy building amazing new things. Because you never stop learning. You're a maker, a doer, a thinker. What gets you fired up is putting pen to paper, sketching concepts, and capturing ideas. You distill complex problems and propose simple, elegant solutions. You're meticulous and excited about beautiful design, and you love seeing products ship.

You're passionate about new technology. You're hungry for new ways to do things. You follow the latest trends, download the newest apps, write/contribute to the relevant design blogs. You have a keen eye for beautiful and useful products, and you share your findings with the team.

You're even more passionate about people. You're a tireless advocate for the end user. You have deep empathy for their everyday struggles and challenges. You always put their needs first, and you're unwavering in your desire to provide the best experience.

You play well with others. You thrive in a collaborative environment. You bring a unique point of view to the table, and bring out the best in your team. You solicit feedback on your own work, and add value to others' work.

You're a disruptor. You love to change the way people behave, for the better. You put the customer at the heart of your process. And you can't wait to apply your UX design chops to deliver unconventional insights and solve major challenges. You're autonomous, on fire, and ready to redefine an industry.

You're inspired by San Francisco. From the days of the Gold Rush to the revolution of Silicon Valley, San Francisco is the home of world-changers. It's an amazing place to live -- from food to art to innovation. Like the original Levi-Strauss (before the 501's), we're creating the tools people use for work every day. And you'll work in downtown San Francisco, at the heart of it all.

Sound like you? Then you're someone we want to work with. Join our outstanding UX team, and you'll get to work with some of the best and brightest of Silicon Valley. When you get a breakthrough idea, our team gives you the power and the people to run with it and make it a reality.
