    <li>User Experience/Interaction Designer</li>
    <li>Design and user experience (UX) are at the forefront of everything we do. The job of an Interaction Designer is to envision how people experience our products and bring that vision to life in a way that feels inspired, refined and even magical. In an Interaction Designer role, you’ll tackle complex tasks and transform them into intuitive, accessible and easy-to-use designs for billions of people around the world—from the first-time user to the sophisticated expert. Achieving this goal requires collaboration with teams of Designers, Researchers, Engineers and Product Managers throughout the design process—from creating user flows and wireframes to building user interface mockups and prototypes. At each stage, you will anticipate what our users need, advocate for them and ensure that the final product surprises and delights them.

These are unique projects that require significant creativity and flexibility from designers. You will be involved in all aspects of design: from early physical and digital explorations through concept prototyping and final pixel-level specification for an experience that spans devices and users. More than anything, an attitude of exploration and openness will lead to success as a Special Projects designer.</li>
