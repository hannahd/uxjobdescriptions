    <li>User Experience Design Intern</li>
    <li>Design and user experience (UX) are at the forefront of everything we do. The job of an Interaction Designer is to envision how people experience our products and bring that vision to life in a way that feels inspired, refined and even magical. In an Interaction Designer role, you’ll tackle complex tasks and transform them into intuitive, accessible and easy-to-use designs for billions of people around the world—from the first-time user to the sophisticated expert. Achieving this goal requires collaboration with teams of Designers, Researchers, Engineers and Product Managers throughout the design process—from creating user flows and wireframes to building user interface mockups and prototypes. At each stage, you will anticipate what our users need, advocate for them and ensure that the final product surprises and delights them.

You plan and execute the UI designs for assigned projects, sometimes taking the lead on moderately complex projects including designing the high-level flow and the detailed interactions of the project.</li>

Additionally, you also have access to <tt>page.name</tt>, which is the filename of the page, that is: index.html.
