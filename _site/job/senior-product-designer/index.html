Etsy’s Product Design team is responsible for wearing many hats at once: from high-level product thinking, to interaction flows and just-enough mockups, all the way to front-end implementation (HTML and CSS). We work with and across every team at Etsy–Product, Engineering, Support, Business, Operations and Marketing–to develop and ship a meaningful, cohesive experience.</li>
