<h1 class="job-meta">at <a href="/company/Microsoft">Microsoft</a> in Redmond, WA from 2014</h1>

<p><p>Are you interested in working on a cutting-edge business that understands and values your work and sees user experience, customer experience, and service design as key strategic priorities? Join us as an interaction design-oriented UXer at Azure, one of the world’s top cloud brands, where you’ll do your best work.<br />
<br />
You’ll design interface experiences that solve complex interactions with elegance and simplicity. The role’s broad scope will give you ample room to flex your design muscles-both on projects that have immediate impact on the Azure business through to long-term explorations that shape our long-term strategy, vision and UX direction. <br />
<br />
Azure is one of the most innovative, tech-driven businesses in the world with huge breadth, reach, and capabilities. You should have a strong interest in technology and know-how to work alongside engineers and product managers, and an ability to tell compelling stories about users and products to support your work. <br />
<br />
Your new UX group is led by an industry hire Group Creative Director who is reshaping the way digital experiences unfold in the universe of Microsoft’s “Metro”/modern design for the developer and IT professional space. The team is comprised of widely talented and diverse individuals with interesting backgrounds and sometimes perplexing passions. It’s an environment where creativity and innovation thrive, and where you can solve hard problems and make a positive impact every day. From our perspective-this is the moment to join, we are ready to grow, positioned to win and will be the next big design team that people wish they were part of. <br /></p>
</p>




<h2>Skills</h2>
<p><p>Thoughtfulness-You’re thoughtful and deliberate in your choices and able to articulate that on the fly across a cross-functional team, and occasionally, conflicting priorities and objectives.   <br />
•   Sales intelligence + persuasion skills-You’ve got the social intelligence and sales skills to understand (or explain) what needs to be changed, and why. You use criticism to spur insightful conversations, not a reason to be defensive or shut down.<br />
•   A translator of tradeoffs-There’s no perfect interface and no right answer. You’re able to create different options and translate the tradeoffs between them in the context of business objectives.   <br />
  A facilitator-You know how to collaborate with others and let them put their concerns on the table.<br />
A strong portfolio is absolutely critical for this role, both in terms of demonstrating your experience and as an example of your ability to create a compelling design presentation. Showcase your experience in UX and interaction design, particularly where simplicity and ease of use were a major concern. We’d like to see a diversity of projects, but be careful that your portfolio doesn’t get scattered or overly long-focus on curation and quality to choose a solid collection of outcomes and design intermediaries and deliverables (especially flows, mockups, and prototypes), and be sure the portfolio demonstrates the design and thought process behind each image.</p>
</p>



<h2>Minimum Qualifications</h2>
<p><p>Design degree or equivalent experience plus 3+ years’ industry experience in interactive design, visual design, and/or information architecture.<br />
•   Demonstrated breadth across IA, usability, IxD, and visual design<br />
•   Ability to create highly polished design prototypes, mockups, and other communication artifacts<br />
•   The ability to quickly turn around rigorous wireframes and mockups quickly in a fast-paced, iterative environment<br />
•   The ability to scope and estimate efforts accurately, prioritize tasks and goals independently, and rapidly produce deliverables<br />
•   Proficiency in a variety of design tools such as Photoshop, Illustrator, Fireworks, OmniGraffle</p>
</p>



<h2>Preferred Qualifications</h2>
<p><p>•   Experience designing user experiences for enterprise software/services<br />
•   Experience with UI design principles and patterns<br />
•   Skills with HTML, JavaScript, CSS a bonus</p>
