<h1 class="job-meta">at <a href="/company/Uber">Uber</a> in London, UK from 2014</h1>

<p>Uber has already found strong product/market fit with its world-changing service.  But it is absolutely day one for us. We’re seeking a small group of unbelievably talented and thoughtful designers to define and execute against a giant vision that builds upon what Uber has brought to the world so far.  <br />
If you have the right stuff to join the Uber London team, you’ll work members of city operations team in a fast-paced, rapidly growing, hybrid (technology/operations) environment.<br />
We are highly customer-centric and we deeply believe we can innovate our way out of any box.  The role demands self management, great execution, quick turnarounds, bold innovation, obsession with quality, fearlessness, and optimism. Ideal candidates will be inspired by the unknown and never settle, solving problems with creativity while keeping the customer in mind and ambition to take projects to the finish line.</p>




<h2>Skills</h2>
<p>Your work is world class.<br />

You’re digital mixed with analog.<br />
You’re a versatile designer that speaks both RGB and CMYK. You know how to make banner ads and rich media emails. You’ve can create press-ready files for flyers, posters, apparel, and other printed collateral. Your portfolio shows a range of work built on a foundation of classical graphic design.<br />
You are a storyteller.<br />
You understand that they key to great communication design is great communication. You use stories to make your work compelling, relevant, and meaningful to your audience.<br />
The details matter to you.<br />
You’ve spent your career slaving over letter spacing and corner rounding. You can’t not bump that object 2px to the left just to get it right. You are a walking encyclopedia of typography and color values.<br />
You move incredibly quickly.<br />
You deliver twice the quality in half the time. You mastered the Creative Suite years ago. You geek out on keyboard shortcuts, Photoshop actions, and the newest prototyping tools. You constantly strive to optimize your workflow, increase your output, and become a more efficient and effective designer.<br />
You can operate independently.<br />
Being the only designer in the office doesn’t frighten you. You work independently, self-manage, and get things done little to no guidance or supervision. You’re comfortable advocating for design to non-designers and representing design in strategic conversations about business goals and marketing plans.<br />
You do whatever it takes.<br />
You’re scrappy. You come up with creative solutions to completing projects in less-than-ideal situations. A lack of resources doesn’t stop you. You enjoy the challenge of finding ways to get it done.</p>
