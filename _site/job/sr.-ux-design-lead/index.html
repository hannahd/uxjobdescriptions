    <li>Amazon’s Universal Shopping Experience team is looking for a Sr. UX Design Lead to drive elegant, customer-focused solutions for the Amazon Fashion shopping experience.

As a design leader you obsess over the details, from how information is architected to visual design. You’re comfortable thinking big at the vision level, across the many platforms our customers interact with us on, and diving deep to explore all the possible paths in order to deliver engaging customer experiences. You’re a talented, passionate designer with uncanny analytic skills, and an impressive ability to build bridges and collaborate with other teams and designers. You repeatedly explore and translate ambiguous business requirements and design concepts into precise interaction and visual design specifications for development and implementation. And, you identify and define UI patterns and best-practice guidelines to help unify design projects and process throughout the Amazon design ecosystem.
