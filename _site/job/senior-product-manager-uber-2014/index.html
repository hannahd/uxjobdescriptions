<h1 class="job-meta">at <a href="/company/Uber">Uber</a> in San Francisco, CA from 2014</h1>

<p><p>Uber has already found strong product/market fit with its world-changing service.  But it is absolutely day one for us.  We’re seeking a small group of unbelievably talented product leaders to define and execute against a giant vision that builds upon what Uber has brought to the world so far.  <br />
 <br />
If you have the right stuff to join the Uber Product team, you’ll work among star engineers, designers and brethren product managers in a fast-paced, rapidly growing, hybrid technology/operations environment.  We are highly customer-centric and we deeply believe we can innovate our way out of any box.  The role demands great technical depth, principled thinking, well honed product judgment, a stubborn refusal to settle, bold innovation, a high design bar and a mentality of starting with the customer and working backwards.<br /></p>
</p>


<h2>Responsibilities</h2>
<p><p>Internalize and deeply understand Uber’s mission and strategies, as well as the mission and objectives of your specific team<br />
Distill vision and strategy for the team, get all members of cross-functional team #superpumped.<br />
Be incredibly truth-seeking.  Collect whatever data is necessary to inform product direction, whether in the form of competitive intel, customer behavior or other business metrics.  Solicit and embrace critical feedback.<br />
Drive cross-functional team to set qualitative objectives and quantitative goals<br />
Drive innovation, definition, deliverables planning (roadmap) and design of entirely new Uber products and product features to deliver against team and company goals. Requires challenging all members of cross-functional team (engineering, design, etc.) to think boldly and creatively and then to funnel that energy into concrete products and execution plans.<br />
Drive definition of and execution against product go-to-market plan, including phasing and marketing.<br />
Monitor and measure launched products and feed learnings back into product development process.<br />
Clearly communicate product plans, benefits and results, as appropriate, to a spectrum of audiences, from internal stakeholders to all Uber employees to customers.</p>
</p>



<h2>Skills</h2>
<p><p>A computer science undergraduate degree or equivalent plus hands-on software engineering experience.  Technical understanding must go from the highest abstractions down to the metal.<br />
7+ years experience delivering highly successful and innovative consumer Internet products with your fingerprints all over them - you’re extremely proud of what you’ve accomplished<br />
Stellar design instincts and product taste<br />
A high bar across the board - from your own contributions to the people you work with to the products you work on.<br />
A “driver” personality - biased toward action, great collaborator and master disambiguator/simplifier - constantly pushing toward clarity and delivery.<br />
Grittiness.  You never hesitate to roll up your sleeves and tackle something hands-on, you persevere when others fall away.<br />
Finger-tippiness with data:  you just go get the data you need with no muss/fuss and can whip it into an insightful story with no help.  You know how to leverage data to make decisions without getting stuck in analysis paralysis.<br />
Customer-centricity - examples from your past of tough product challenges that you powered through because you were unwilling to make your problems your customers’ problems.<br />
True passion for Uber’s mission and the company’s hybrid technology / operations nature.<br />
A never-ending desire to grow and learn.</p>
