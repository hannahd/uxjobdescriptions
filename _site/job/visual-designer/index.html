    <li>Excited to change the face of local commerce? To communicate new tools to merchants that will allow them to compete with online and big box retail, and reduce the friction in their interactions with customers? This is exactly what design at Groupon Merchant OS does. We cultivate deep empathy for these users, and translate this understanding into inventive, effective and delightful visual stories that cross channels and devices (email, web, mobile, and tablet).

Experience working with international design departments and integrating design guidelines across departments, platforms, teams!
