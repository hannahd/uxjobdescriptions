You’re meticulous and excited about data-driven design, and you love seeing products ship.<br />
 <br />
You play well with others. You thrive in a collaborative environment. You bring a unique point of view to the table and bring out the best in your team, your peers, and your executives. You solicit feedback on your own work and add value to others’ work.<br />
