    <li>Product Designer, UX</li>
    <li>Uber has already found strong product/market fit with its world-changing service.  But it is absolutely day one for us. We’re seeking a small group of unbelievably talented and thoughtful designers to define and execute against a giant vision that builds upon what Uber has brought to the world so far.
If you have the right stuff to join the Uber Experience Design team, you’ll work among design oriented engineers, product managers and some of the best designers in a fast-paced, rapidly growing, hybrid (technology/operations) environment.
We are highly user-centric and we deeply believe we can innovate our way out of any box.  The role demands great execution, bold innovation, obsession with quality, fearlessness and optimism to be inspired by the unknown and never settle, solving problems with creativity while keeping the user in mind and ambition to take projects to the finish line.</li>

Additionally, you also have access to <tt>page.name</tt>, which is the filename of the page, that is: index.html.
