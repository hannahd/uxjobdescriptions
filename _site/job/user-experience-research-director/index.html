    <li>User Experience Research Director</li>
    <li>E*TRADE is undergoing a transformation to become an insights-driven organization, and, as a result, we are building a high-performance research team that will partner with internal clients to embed research and insights into their business processes.
The UX Research team is a newly-formed organization responsible for guiding the development of digital experiences across platforms and technologies. We are looking for a highly-motivated executive who can lead this team, set a vision for the function, and implement best-in-class quantitative and qualitative UX research techniques, to help drive transformational improvements in our user experiences.
User experience research is a very collaborative effort at E*TRADE, involving the UX Design, Visual Design, Product Strategy, Channel Strategy, and Market Research teams. You’ll engage business partners to assess research opportunities, determine priorities, and make recommendations that balance strategic and tactical business needs. You will also be responsible for refining team processes, enhancing research methodologies, developing team members, and maintaining research quality by reviewing team work products.
The team operates as a consultative “internal supplier” that manages the majority of projects in-house, and also works with external vendors. Therefore, the successful candidate will be an expert at translating both strategic and tactical business needs into research requirements, have deep knowledge of UX research methods, be an effective user-testing interviewer, and have hands-on experience with online research tools, as well as experience managing vendors.
We operate in a dynamic, fast-paced environment, so the Director will be responsible for maximizing team productivity, prioritizing projects, and managing the team-wide research pipeline, while also managing an independent portfolio of blue-chip projects. </li>
