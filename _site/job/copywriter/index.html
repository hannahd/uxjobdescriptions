<h1>index.html</h1>

<p>This page is automatically generated by the <tt>data_page_generator.rb</tt> plugin, based on the <tt>_layouts/job.html</tt> template.</p>

<p>Use the <tt>_config.yml</tt> to specify the rules for generating pages like this one (including name and template).</p>

<p>In the template, you have access to all the fields defined in <tt>data</tt> for the record, like, for instance:</p>

<p>Date,Company,Location,Title,Summary,Responsibilities,Skills,Min_Qualifications,Preferred_Qualifications</p>

<ul>
    <li>8/15/2014</li>
    <li>Vimeo</li>
    <li>New York, NY</li>
    <li>Copywriter</li>
    <li>Vimeo is growing like a magical beanstalk and the word department needs some help. If you find yourself chuckling at other people’s malapropisms, sneaking off to the bathroom to read Ulysses Annotated, and/or writing punchy headlines to describe mundane moments in your life (“Elevator Conversation Expertly Avoided”), we would like to hear from you. Actually, there is no audio component to the job application, so “hear from you” is a bit inaccurate. But you already knew that.

</ul>

Additionally, you also have access to <tt>page.name</tt>, which is the filename of the page, that is: index.html.
