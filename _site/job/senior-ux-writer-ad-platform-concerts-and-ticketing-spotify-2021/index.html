<h1 class="job-meta">at <a href="/company/Spotify">Spotify</a> in New York, NY from 2/21/2021</h1>

<p><p>Help us build the platform that powers promotion at Spotify!<br />
<br />
We’re searching for a Senior UX Writer to join our New York-based Ad Platform team, focused on both our Platform and Concerts &amp; Ticketing efforts team — working at this intersection you’ll both build the foundations of our advertising platform and experiment with their direct applications via our Concerts &amp; Ticketing efforts. <br />
<br />
We are looking for someone with experience partnering with technology, product and insights teams to drive key company initiatives. Someone who is passionate about developing strategies based on insights from real people, has the proficiency in their craft to turn these insights into frameworks, strategies and content, and who wants to contribute to develop the practice of UX Writing at Spotify. <br />
<br />
Ad Platform<br />
<br />
Our Ad Platform consists of the foundational capabilities, systems, frameworks and guidelines that underpin all the promotional activity on Spotify. We partner with other teams to turn these foundations into powerful tools for brands, creators and internal teams, as well as intuitive experiences for our listeners. As a Senior UX Writer  working on these foundations, you will be positioned to impact spaces where design does not traditionally have a role, defining how design can operate and using our design superpowers for good. This is a team for people who want to think deeply about system design and enjoy being pioneers, who love to partner with other functions and thrive where communication skills are key.</p>
</p>


<h2>Responsibilities</h2>
<p><p>Work with designers, researchers, product managers and engineers to deliver compelling content solutions. You’ll lead projects across the entire product lifecycle and multiple product launches. Together with your cross-functional partners, you’ll set the vision for the user experience and create the space for others to collaborate. Success will require fostering a shared understanding of the problem space using your skills to bring people together.<br />
Pioneer the role of UX Writing in deeply technical spaces, bringing the concerns of our listeners with you, and taking on deep questions, for example “how do content strategy and machine learning systems intersect to create amazing listener and brand outcomes?”<br />
Apply big-picture thinking to break down open-ended opportunities into meaningful next steps and find new opportunities for work that span across our organizational boundaries. You’ll connect with other UX Writers across the organization to build shared viewpoints and cohesive strategies.<br />
Develop standards and frameworks for promotion at Spotify — listening and curating, or leading and defining, as needed. You’ll influence the development of the UX Writing function in our Ad business and in Spotify as a whole. You’ll help promote an understanding for your craft and the value it brings to the product development process.<br />
Act autonomously and take ownership. You’ll provide teams with the methods, process and solutions needed to execute strategy. You’ll drive progress through obstacles by building consensus and making decisions - taking ownership for every last detail, every step of the way.</p>
</p>



<h2>Skills</h2>
<p><p>You have proven experience writing or editing content for the web and mobile experiences, as a UX writer, information architect, content strategist, or similar. Experience designing for B2B and SaaS tools are big pluses.<br />
Bonus if you have experience in Advertising or Messaging ecosystem contexts.<br />
A great communicator. You love to collaborate with lots of different functions.<br />
A systems-thinker who loves to create simple and elegant experiences for complex products.<br />
Have the skills to help set up frameworks and brainstorm initial design concepts.<br />
You often find yourself operating at the intersection of content strategy, UX thinking and copy.<br />
Have the ability to mentor others to deliver work, and help bring strategy to life.<br />
A holistic user experience problem solver that considers every facet of the user journey.<br />
You enjoy solving problems, big and small, for all kinds of users. You are constantly looking to hone your executions through user feedback.<br />
A specialist in your craft, but you recognize the importance of setting aside the time and space to learn and grow.<br />
You have a portfolio or case studies that you can share with us, to help us learn how you think and practice your craft.</p>
