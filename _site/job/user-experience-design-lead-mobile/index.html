    <li>Design and user experience (UX) are at the forefront of everything we do. The job of an Interaction Designer is to envision how people experience our products and bring that vision to life in a way that feels inspired, refined and even magical. In an Interaction Designer role, you’ll tackle complex tasks and transform them into intuitive, accessible and easy-to-use designs for billions of people around the world—from the first-time user to the sophisticated expert. Achieving this goal requires collaboration with teams of Designers, Researchers, Engineers and Product Managers throughout the design process—from creating user flows and wireframes to building user interface mockups and prototypes. At each stage, you will anticipate what our users need, advocate for them and ensure that the final product surprises and delights them.

YouTube is seeking a creative design lead to join the User Experience team. We are looking for a senior designer with strong people management skills who can cooperate across functional lines to manage the product vision and guide the mobile UX team. The work is challenging, creative, fast paced and intellectually stimulating. YouTube mobile requires a harmonious experience across multiple platforms and product lines and creating this involves interactions with many teams. Knowledge of the strengths and weeknesses of many devices is essential. Join us and help lead the vision for the future of YouTube across mobile platforms.</li>
