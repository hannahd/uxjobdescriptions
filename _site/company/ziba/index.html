                  <p class="job-meta"><em>Portland, OR from 2014</em></p>
                  <p>Interaction designers at Ziba are thinkers and makers with a passion for solving problems and creating experiences people love. That requires balancing form, function, movement and beauty. Our intention is lofty – humanize technology by making the best possible user experiences – but that doesn’t mean we’re afraid to get our hands dirty. Putting functional prototypes into users’ hands early and often is crucial.<br />
<br />
Interaction design at Ziba means creating the future with some of the most recognized brands in the world – you’ve heard of FedEx, Intel and adidas, right? Our work is complex, but win-win-wins are possible: business and consumer needs woven together into products we’re proud of. Our solutions do right by our clients and delight the people who use them.<br />
