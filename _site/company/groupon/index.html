<h2>Responsibilities</h2>

You avoid derivative solutions, you are not happy being me-too, you push the envelope. You think systems (not one-offs). Your work is modular, scalable. You wield both the art and science of design into actionable, replicable solutions. You think of graphic design as a living interaction, not static output.<br />
<br />

<br />
Prototypes, workflows, wireframes, and other elements of making explicit the functional and systems core of a product’s design, across all relevant channels and devices<br />
<br />
Craft prototypes of proposed website designs. If it moves, if it behaves… we get faster and closer to the truth when evangelizing internally and testing on our audience<br />
<br />

<br />
Work closely with product managers and engineers to complete projects</p>

<br />

<br />
Strong portfolio featuring examples of both graphic design and interaction work. Any experience working on the mobile and/or devices industry is highly appreciated<br />
<br />
A strong, clean visual design sense, valuing innovation, beautiful simplicity, and smart consistency (cats optional)<br />
<br />
Expertise on the whole Adobe suite is assumed… but any skills on Framer, Sketch, Mirror and other prototyping tools will be something we look for.<br />
<br />
Great design communication skills; able to tell the story of a design from end to end<br />
<br />
Solid grounding in fundamentals of typography, color, layout, content hierarchy<br />
<br />
Ability to set (and/or follow) interface guidelines, style guides, and best practices when designing for new platforms, and an ability to intelligently challenge and improve them when necessary<br />
<br />
Proven experience designing for the modern, responsive web<br />
<br />
Comfort working in fast-moving, agile development environments with sometimes ambiguous and changing goals<br />
<br />
Healthy sense of humor (see point above)<br />
<br />
Ability to think about high-level product vision and contribute a vision of a fantastic user experiences, is a welcome skill<br />
<br />

<h2>Preferred Qualifications</h2>
<p>Familiarity with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the technologies that you’re designing for is kinda useful, a lot, actually.<br />
<br />
Experience with versioning, SVN, or preferably Git… would be unbelievably awesome (but not required, we are just reaching for the gold here)<br />
<br />
Experience with e-commerce and local business<br />
<br />
Experience working with Ruby on Rails and jQuery? That is just icing-on-the-cake! (you are a monster by the way)<br />
<br />
