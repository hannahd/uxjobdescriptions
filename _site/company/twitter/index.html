                  <p class="job-meta"><em>San Francisco, CA from 2014</em></p>
                  <p>Twitter is looking for a designer to work on products and experiences<br />
for our TV & Video related initiatives. You’ll work with engineering<br />
and product teams to build an intuitive, powerful platform that serves<br />
multinational brands, small businesses, and everyone in between.<br />
You’ll also be thinking about ads and commerce experiences that<br />
enhance, rather than detract from, Twitter for both businesses and<br />
consumers, while working with people across the company to make it<br />
happen. You care about building tools that help people achieve their<br />
goals easily, whether on desktop or mobile, and you have an interest<br />
in data exploration and visualization.</p>
