    <li>Amplify has an exciting opportunity for a Visual Designer to help design initiatives for next generation tablet, web and print-based educational products aimed at grades K-12. We are looking for an exceptional talent to join our team as we re-envision elementary school curriculum and re-invent the classroom learning experience in English Language Arts, Science and Math.

The Visual Designer will work with Design and Art Directors to establish the visual direction of Amplify’s digital curriculum-based content and products. The ideal candidate will be able to understand a product’s vision, and translate it into unique and comprehensive design solutions in collaboration with cross-functional teams and external vendors. The Visual Designer will demonstrate solid conceptual, visualization, and communication skills during all phases of creative development from inception to launch. The position requires a deep understanding of current technologies and design trends, and the desire to push the limits of innovation, creativity and storytelling using both digital and print platforms.
