You want to a build a mobile service that helps people live better and more fun lives in the real world: discover awesome places, get insider tips, keep up and meet up with friends.

                  <p class="job-meta"><em>New York, NY from 8/13/2014</em></p>
                  <p>Foursquare is seeking a passionate, curious, and thoughtful designer to join our Product Experience & Design Team. We believe we're changing the way people experience the world around them, and we want someone who's eager to play a huge role in defining how. We work as a tight, cross-disciplinary team, so you need to feel comfortable working closely with a variety of teams, as well as your fellow designers, to evolve the product and the brand across our mobile clients.<br />
<br />
As a designer, you will be involved in every aspect of the product development process – from brainstorming the next feature – to tweaking pixels right up to code freeze if necessary. <br />
<br />
You never make a design decision without considering the impact on the overall experience. You're comfortable quickly iterating your way to a final, well-thought-out solution. You know how to articulate the rationale behind every design decision you make, and you know how to ask the right questions. You also know how to toe the line between practical and playful. </p>
