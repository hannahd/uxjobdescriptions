    <li>As a User Interface Engineer, you’ll live by the maxim “the interface is the product”. Working simultaneously with seasoned UI designers and a world-class software-infrastructure team, you can focus on delighting users with both large new features and (thanks to our continuous deployment architecture) daily small product enhancements.

By leveraging our in-house framework, Luna, you can rapidly build applications with properties like immediate responsiveness and real-time syncing. Luna changes the way you think about writing applications, including the elimination of a separation between “frontend code” and “backend code.” This is an opportunity to use a new paradigm for building interactive software, and to drive the requirements for its ongoing development.</li>

Additionally, you also have access to <tt>page.name</tt>, which is the filename of the page, that is: index.html.
