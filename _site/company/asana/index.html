                  <h2><strong>Head of Product Design</strong></h2>
                  <p class="job-meta"><em>San Francisco, CA from 2014</em></p>
                  <p>We’re looking for the people manager who will design Asana’s design organization and create a great experience for the individual contributors. This person will help make both our design team and our product a dream to work in.<br />
<br />
Asana is going after a huge mission – to help humanity thrive by enabling all teams to work together effortlessly. We’re on a very strong trajectory toward getting there, with organizations like Dropbox, Airbnb, Uber, SimpleHuman, Nest, CERN, the NYC Department of Education, and tens of thousands of others already running their internal communication on Asana. We believe the person who takes this role will end up having a substantial impact on designing the future how teams of humans work together.<br />
<br />
We currently have a team of 7 very talented product designers. What we need is an experienced design leader who can harness that talent and take the product to the next level. Ultimately, great user experience is Asana’s raison d’etre.<br />
<br />
Opportunities to make things better<br />
<br />
This is an opportunity to come into a product and a team that already have traction solving important problems for well-respected customers, and make the product and team far better than they are today.<br />
<br />
The User Experience. While we think there’s no other teamwork product with this much power that’s this simple, we believe that great design leadership will help us express that power in a form that is vastly easier for customers to grok – and more beautiful and delightful.<br />
<br />
On the one hand, customers today love how Asana helps them accomplish more than they could before. They tell us they appreciate that workflows are efficient, interactions are optimized, and the interface affords them a ton of organizational power. On the other hand, many users find Asana’s UI too complicated (and rightfully so), especially as we move further into the mainstream of knowledge workers. We’re excited about the huge opportunity this presents.<br />
<br />
The Team. The Asana design team has a strong bench of raw design talent, with ICs of varying levels of experience. A great design leader can provide the mentorship necessary to elevate each IC to a world-class crafts[wo]man. You will also develop the organization and its processes so that the whole is much more than the sum of its parts, producing a user experience that feels born from a single consistent perspective.</p>

                  <p>On the design team, we take pride in the craft of building products: coming up with ideas, testing them against our users and our teammates across the company, creating polished design artifacts, and taking a leading role alongside our engineers in making sure our designs are well-implemented and bulletproof. Asana is a company of peers: you’ll work with people who come in every morning to decide what needs to be done to accomplish the goals we’ve all helped define, and then take ownership for the speed of the execution on those goals.</p>

                  <p>As an Asana product manager, you’ll play an integral role in building out Asana’s vision for revolutionizing the ways that teams work together and enabling teams around the world to accomplish more. You’ll be responsible for the product from strategy to execution, working with designers, engineers, the founders, user ops, sales, marketing, and other PMs to help build the best product possible.<br />

                  <p>As a User Interface Engineer, you’ll live by the maxim “the interface is the product”. Working simultaneously with seasoned UI designers and a world-class software-infrastructure team, you can focus on delighting users with both large new features and (thanks to our continuous deployment architecture) daily small product enhancements.<br />
<br />
By leveraging our in-house framework, Luna, you can rapidly build applications with properties like immediate responsiveness and real-time syncing. Luna changes the way you think about writing applications, including the elimination of a separation between “frontend code” and “backend code.” This is an opportunity to use a new paradigm for building interactive software, and to drive the requirements for its ongoing development.</p>
