    <li>Mobile Rapid UI Prototype Developer</li>
    <li>As an iOS Rapid UI Prototype Developer, you will work closely with our design team to bring ideas to life. You will channel your hackathon mentality to transform fleeting “what ifs” into real functioning prototypes. Your eye for UI/UX will give you the creative confidence to develop v1.0 of new Snapchat products, the way you think they should feel.

You will write throwaway code, because you never cared for that mundane extensibility / efficiency / compatibility stuff anyways. But your work will be instrumental in testing ideas and ultimately determining the products we ship.

This is a great opportunity for a developer to have significant impact on the design of our future products while forming the bridge between the design and development teams.
