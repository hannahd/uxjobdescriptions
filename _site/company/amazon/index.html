At Amazon we pride ourselves on putting the customer first in everything we do. We start with the customer and work backwards. If you can create beautiful design that engages our customers and inspires them, then we want you to join us.<br />
<br />
Amazon needs to maintain a strong brand whilst also developing unique approaches for merchandising a wide variety of products in the most appealing way. If you have a world class portfolio with FMCG, branding and marketing communications, then you’ll be off to a good start. If you have strong digital experience but understand how to apply your work to any media, then you’re flying. If you can also show evidence that you understand customer behaviour and how to change your designs to maximize the return to the business, then you’ll be the superstar we’re looking for.<br />
<br />
We’re currently looking for Senior Designers/Art Directors and a highly experienced Creative with a good business mind to lead the creative direction of the team (you’ll most likely be a hands-on creative director within a big team). Positions are currently based in Slough, but will be relocating to central London by 2015.</p>
