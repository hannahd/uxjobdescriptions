    <li>UI/UX Graphic Designer</li>
    <li>Hi, we're EAT24 and we need a UI/UX Graphic Designer to keep our mobile apps, websites, ads, and email campaigns looking sexy. That means we need you to have at least a few years of experience designing for web and mobile app UI/UX with a kick-ass portfolio to back it up. Ideally you also have some understanding of business strategies and user research, as well as an ability to play well with others and adapt to specific styleguides.</li>

Additionally, you also have access to <tt>page.name</tt>, which is the filename of the page, that is: index.html.
