You’re digital mixed with analog.<br />
You’re a versatile designer that speaks both RGB and CMYK. You know how to make banner ads and rich media emails. You’ve can create press-ready files for flyers, posters, apparel, and other printed collateral. Your portfolio shows a range of work built on a foundation of classical graphic design.<br />
You are a storyteller.<br />
You understand that they key to great communication design is great communication. You use stories to make your work compelling, relevant, and meaningful to your audience.<br />
The details matter to you.<br />

Being the only designer in the office doesn’t frighten you. You work independently, self-manage, and get things done little to no guidance or supervision. You’re comfortable advocating for design to non-designers and representing design in strategic conversations about business goals and marketing plans.<br />
You do whatever it takes.<br />
You’re scrappy. You come up with creative solutions to completing projects in less-than-ideal situations. A lack of resources doesn’t stop you. You enjoy the challenge of finding ways to get it done.</p>
