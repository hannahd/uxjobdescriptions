                  <p class="job-meta"><em>New York, NY from 2/21/2021</em></p>
                  <p>You’ll lead multiple projects across the entire product lifecycle. You’ll set the vision for the user experience and create the space for others to collaborate. <br />
Employ your strength in storytelling to present your vision and design rationale in a compelling, convincing manner to the wider team. <br />
You'll work with multi-disciplinary teams on strategic, epic-level, cross-company initiatives that intersect multiple teams and business units. You’ll proactively partner with designers, researchers, product managers and engineers to arrive at elegant, practical and forward-thinking solutions to big design challenges. <br />
You’ll take your seat at the cross-functional leadership table to inform the vision and strategy of the work that we do.<br />
Consider the two-sided nature of the problem space. You’ll play in audio-forward, multimodal spaces, introducing new ways for listeners to engage with ads and promoted content. You’ll explore how these experiences span different user types, situations and devices. You’ll work to define the systems and tooling that power these experiences.<br />
You’ll apply big-picture thinking to break down open-ended opportunities into actionable next steps. You will realize these ideas with the appropriate level of detail and fidelity at every phase, while tailoring those outputs for a variety of stakeholders. <br />
You’ll operate autonomously, defining and providing the business unit with systems to best execute against current and future strategy. You’ll drive progress through obstacles by balancing collaboration, alignment and decisiveness  - taking responsibility for every last detail, every step of the way.<br />
You can flexibly operate across different types of engagements. You love to think big, but you know when it makes sense to go deep. You can help lay the groundwork to set new problem spaces up for success, and you can provide exceptional hands-on execution as necessary.<br />
You’ll help us push the envelope and keep the best interests of all of our users (listeners, artists, marketers and advertisers) at heart. The ad-tech domain is fast-paced, prone to dark UX patterns (which we want to avoid), and not necessarily intuitive. We are hoping to challenge those antiquated values, and an existing understanding and ability to evangelize is valuable for the role.</p>

You’ll apply big-picture thinking to break down open-ended opportunities into actionable next steps. You will realize these ideas with the appropriate level of detail and fidelity at every phase, while tailoring those outputs for a variety of stakeholders. <br />
You’ll operate autonomously, defining and providing the business unit with systems to best execute against current and future strategy. You’ll drive progress through obstacles by balancing collaboration, alignment and decisiveness  - taking responsibility for every last detail, every step of the way.<br />
You can flexibly operate across different types of engagements. You love to think big, but you know when it makes sense to go deep. You can help lay the groundwork to set new problem spaces up for success, and you can provide exceptional hands-on execution as necessary.<br />
You’ll help us push the envelope and keep the best interests of all of our users (listeners, artists, marketers and advertisers) at heart. The ad-tech domain is fast-paced, prone to dark UX patterns (which we want to avoid), and not necessarily intuitive. We are hoping to challenge those antiquated values, and an existing understanding and ability to evangelize is valuable for the role.</p>
