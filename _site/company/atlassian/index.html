                  <p class="job-meta"><em>Sydney, Australia from 2014</em></p>
                  <p>Do you have a drive for finding out why people do the things they do with software products, and how those products could be improved? And do you get a kick out of putting research practices in place for everyone to use?<br />
<br />
At Atlassian we develop products in cross-disciplinary teams that are united in wanting to provide the best experience for customers we can. We believe in investing in continual customer research to inform our thinking and our design. Research at Atlassian asks the tough questions, and works with teams to answer those questions. In this role you will investigate what our customers need and return actionable insights, grow and scale research as an integrated discipline at Atlassian, work with teams to define hypotheses and success measures, and conduct whatever research is necessary to ensure we achieve those measures.<br />
<br />
Being a researcher at Atlassian<br />
<br />
Research at Atlassian ensures there are not only eyes on what our customers think and say about our products (and do in our products), but a way to turn results into action. Research is employed throughout our process, from early stage concepts and ideation, through to implementation, ongoing improvement and customer support. We're dedicated to agile methodology and are believers in 'lean', which means we despise documentation for documentation's sake. We are extremely self-driven, and do our very best at all times to validate assumptions about our customers.<br />
<br />
We need a researcher who knows how to work out the right research to do at the right time, with the communication and persuasion skills to educate everyone about what that research means for them, and to help them take ownership of implementing whatever the impact of that research is. Atlassian is growing, and it's important that research doesn't belong to a few, but is scaled throughout the company with the right tools, training and techniques. We also have a thriving growth hacking team who run ongoing experiments to optimise usability and usefulness of our products; it's important that you know how to integrate results from various research and testing programs into a coherent truthful story.<br />

                  <p>Designers at Atlassian are responsible for the complete user experience, from early stage research and ideation, through implementation and iteration based on key success metrics. We're dedicated to agile methodology and are believers in 'lean', which means we despise documentation for documentation's sake. We are extremely self-driven, and do our very best at all times to validate assumptions about our users with various types of testing. <br />
<br />
We are not looking for designers who just want to concentrate on one skill in design, such as user research or visual design --  we need you to be eager to deliver across the entirety of the design process. We expect you to be really good in at least one design-focused skill. And while you'll be so good at this that you can teach the rest of us what you know, you also have to be interested to improve in many other skills, and humble enough to always reach out to learn more.  <br />
<br />
Designers at Atlassian are either focused on a specific product like JIRA, a cross-product initiative such as registration and signup, or in a global team that maintains our design libraries and ensures we have the right techniques and research to be successful. <br />
<br />
The Senior UX Designer role will be responsible for ensuring our brand doesn't stop at the doors. You will be working with our IT group on a variety of projects that are both internal and external customer facing, including creating useful experiences with our new personalization engine, building a community portal where customers can help each other, and making our internal tools and processes reflect our commitment to great user experience.<br />
We're expecting you to bring 5+ years of hands-on professional experience as a UX Designer or Interaction Designer, ideally with SaaS or complex web-based enterprise applications. You will be working on projects that discover and resolve problems in Information Architecture and interaction design, and which require strong skills in facilitation and collaboration, relationship building, and driving for outcomes.  The projects will also require the ability to drive user research and do some visual design, based on an existing style guide and component library.</p>
