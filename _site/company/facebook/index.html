    <li>Every day, Facebook is altering the way people communicate and share information. As a Facebook researcher, you can fundamentally affect people's lives in a real and meaningful way. In turn, we ensure you have everything you need to focus on this mission and be invested in its success. The goal of the User Experience team (UX) is to improve the user experience by incorporating research, insights and content strategy into the product cycle. As a UX Researcher, you will work closely with product teams throughout the design process to identify opportunities for research, choose the appropriate methods, conduct the research and analyze and present results. Your toolbox should consist of both qualitative and quantitative methods, such as expert reviews, user tests, and journal studies, as well as experiments, surveys and A/B testing. (Experience with log analysis or statistical analysis is a plus.) As a partner to product design teams, you should have strong communication skills, drawing on your experience with design to describe and sometimes mock-up suggestions in research reports. While your main focus as a UX Researcher will be to investigate specific products and interfaces and work closely with product design teams, we also focus on larger usability and content issues across the site. As a result, you should have a strong understanding of social media, good product instincts, a creative approach to research design, and a bold, entrepreneurial attitude.</li>

Additionally, you also have access to <tt>page.name</tt>, which is the filename of the page, that is: index.html.
