                  <p>We are hiring a Senior Product Design Manager to lead the design team in charge of systems and experiences across mobile and desktop that make Slack simpler to use and easier to build for. <br />
<br />
Product Design Managers serve a vital role at Slack: they elevate the health, growth, and development of their team, as well as care for the overall business. They have a passion for design excellence expressed through thoughtful creative direction and occasionally rolling up their sleeves to lead by example. <br />
<br />
Slack has a positive, diverse, and supportive culture. We appreciate design leaders who are curious, humble, think deeply, speak clearly, and thrive on collaboration and feedback. If this sounds like a good fit for you, send us a nice hello with links to your work and experience.</p>

                  <p>We are hiring a Staff Product Designer to help craft the future of Slack. Staff Designers are leaders within our teams. They help to define product direction and set/hold the bar for design. They carry features from vision through to execution and launch, all the while prototyping and honing the design to ensure it works for Slack’s diverse user base. Lastly, they are seen as leaders in their own right - helping to set the tone for work at Slack by being humble, smart, and collaborative.</p>

<br />
We are looking for a designer who has a balance of great visual design coupled with an eye for motion design who can tell a story. These two crafts paired together can create lifelike movement, and improves the user experience by making it more purposeful and enjoyable. Motion brings the soul to world-class visual design. As the lead visual and motion designer at Slack, you will define Slack’s app visual and interaction language  and will work closely with our design systems team to codify it under SlackKit. </p>

                  <h2><strong>Sr. Product Manager, Monetization</strong></h2>
                  <p class="job-meta"><em>Remote, US from 2/21/2021</em></p>
                  <p>We are looking for a senior product manager to help us grow our customer base and make every team on Slack more productive through our premium products. This is a unique opportunity to shape the growth of Slack and an entire industry by ensuring Slack is “where work gets done", especially as the world shifts to remote. <br />
<br />
With the introduction of free trials, Slack is converting paid customers at a record pace, with paid customers up 140% year-over-year. We’ll look to you to further accelerate this growth. As the product manager, you will be leading the user experience for hundreds of thousands of teams on trials, creating a user-friendly experience and developing a compelling case for upgrade. You will be setting the strategy and product direction to help all teams see the value in paying for a premium plan. <br />
<br />
You are a business-minded product manager. You’re constantly coming up with great new feature ideas and thinking critically about which of them will make the biggest impact. You have strong user empathy and have experience building user-facing products. You know how to measure and interpret the results of your team’s efforts. You thrive in cross-functional roles and love working side-by-side with the best engineers and designers. You easily manage several projects at once. You work well under pressure, and you are accountable to results.</p>

                  <h2><strong>Product Lead, Emerging Products</strong></h2>
                  <p class="job-meta"><em>San Francisco, CA from 2/21/2021</em></p>
                  <p>Slack is looking for a Product Lead to lead our new “Emerging Products” group. The focus is building new product capabilities that make Slack feel like the essential digital replacement for the physical office as the world rapidly moves to (hybrid) remote work. This is the biggest opportunity to invent the future of work since we first launched Slack.<br />
<br />
We know every team wants to move faster, get aligned, and feel connected – from the Fortune 500 to the Fortune 500,000. These needs are becoming even more pronounced as Covid compresses a decade-long shift to distributed work into a year. As companies move remote, there is an urgent need to replace formerly synchronous, in-person processes and meetings with alternatives that offer more async flexibility and spontaneity – and ultimately boost efficiency, productivity, and connectedness.<br />
<br />
Slack is poised to be that essential digital replacement for the “jobs” of the physical office. We are starting with two opportunities: 1) Asynchronous, AV “Stories” to boost team connection and alignment and 2) Ambient and ad hoc audio to encourage spontaneous collaboration. But, this is just the beginning. The jobs are clear for the unbundled physical office: ad hoc collaboration, alignment, serendipitous connections, and ambient awareness. These are the jobs Slack is poised to become essential for, since Slack already brings together everyone you work with into channels for every team, project, event, and customer.<br />
<br />
That’s where you hopefully come in! This role is perfect for a product leader who wants to effectively join as an early “co-founder”. You will lead creating new products in this rapidly evolving space and shaping the new Emerging Products group. It’s many of the best parts of a startup, but layered on top of Slack the product and Slack the company. You should be excited to start off shaping the product direction, driving execution, figuring out our GTM approach, and sweating the little big details all yourself – and eventually growing a PM team as we take on more opportunities. Hundreds of millions of people are struggling to work in this new hybrid remote world – how can we build products that make their working lives simpler, more pleasant, and more productive?</p>

                  <h2><strong>Sr. Content Designer</strong></h2>
                  <p class="job-meta"><em>Denver, CO from 2/21/2021</em></p>
                  <p>Hi there! Slack is looking for an experienced content designer to work closely with product teams, and to help shape the craft of product content as a whole. If you excel at using language to build great user experiences, have a background in building content systems and style guides, and are passionate about voice and tone, please get in touch.<br />
<br />
A bit about Content Design at Slack: We’re part of the Product Design group, and we work to make sure Slack sounds human. We’re a smallish (but growing!) team, and we delight in giving and receiving feedback to help each other be the best UX writers and thinkers we can be. We care about wit and deftness with tone, but we care most of all about clarity and helping users get things done. We have strong feelings (oh, do we) about sentence case and exclamation marks — and we’d love to hear yours.</p>
