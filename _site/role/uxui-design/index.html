                  <p>We believe great design comes from fusing the art and science of design, but both are rarely found within a single individual. We prefer to create a team with some people specializing in the art of design and others in the science of design. For this particular role, we need a visual designer with expertise in the art of design; an individual who can channel his/her passion for design excellence to deliver solutions inspired by a deep desire to create emotionally compelling branded experiences.<br />
<br />
We work collaboratively to produce and ship real products. To that end, we need a team player who can turn a variety of requirements into clear and simple solutions. We need you, if you are driven by a passion for great visual design; a designer who can channel that passion to deliver solutions that are creatively inspired and pragmatically realized. We need you, if you are a humble expert; if you can effectively engage in projects from concept to production, nail the details, and enjoy learning from and collaborating with other designers, software engineers, product managers, and marketing to deliver compelling experiences.<br />
<br />
Does any of this resonate with you? If so, then consider joining our UX team. We’re a small team that’s highly experienced, at the table, and impactful</p>

                  <p>Foursquare is seeking a passionate, curious, and thoughtful designer to join our Product Experience & Design Team. We believe we're changing the way people experience the world around them, and we want someone who's eager to play a huge role in defining how. We work as a tight, cross-disciplinary team, so you need to feel comfortable working closely with a variety of teams, as well as your fellow designers, to evolve the product and the brand across our mobile clients.<br />
<br />
The designer we’re looking for is fluent in current UI & UX best practices, and also knows exactly when to throw them out the window and blaze a new trail. You’ll be involved in every aspect of the product development process – from brainstorming the next feature – to tweaking pixels right up to code freeze if necessary. <br />
<br />
You never make a design decision without considering the impact on the overall experience. You're comfortable quickly iterating your way to a final, well-thought-out solution. You know how to articulate the rationale behind every design decision you make, and you know how to ask the right questions. You also know how to toe the line between practical and playful.</p>
