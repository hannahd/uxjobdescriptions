                  <p>User Experience (UX) Prototypers are the synthesis of design and development. They take Google's most innovative product concepts and bring them to life in an effort to push the boundaries of user interface design. Google is known for its design aesthetic and technical know-how. In a UX Prototyper job, you'll need both types of skills to develop the next generation of products. You'll partner with Researchers and Designers to define and deliver new features, test new concepts and assist with final implementation. Details are critical as you iterate on complex interactions, animations and pixel-perfect visual designs.<br />
<br />
You work independently on many projects, but also incorporate feedback from team members across the organization. You will use your experience to drive medium to large-sized tasks and projects while exercising considerable independent judgment and discretion.The impact of your work is huge as Google touches millions of users every day.</p>
