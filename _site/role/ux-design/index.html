                  <p>At Google, we follow a simple but vital premise: "Focus on the user and all else will follow." Google’s Interaction Designers take complex tasks and make them intuitive and easy-to-use for billions of people around the globe. Throughout the design process—from creating user flows and wireframes to building user interface mockups and prototypes—you’ll envision how people will experience our products, and bring that vision to life in a way that feels inspired, refined, and even magical.<br />
<br />
Google User Experience (UX) is made up of multi-disciplinary teams of UX Designers, Researchers, Writers, Content Strategists, Program Managers, and Engineers: we care deeply about the people who use our products. The UX team plays an integral part in gathering insights about the attitudes, emotions, and behaviors of people who use our products to inspire and inform design. We collaborate closely with each other and with engineering and product management to create industry-leading products that deliver value for the people who use them, and for Google’s businesses.<br />
<br />
As an Interaction Designer, you’ll rely on user-centered design methods to craft industry-leading user experiences—from concept to execution. Like all of our UX jobs, you’ll collaborate with your design partners to leverage and evolve the Google design language to build beautiful, innovative, inspired products that people love to use.</p>

                  <p class="job-meta"><em><a href="/company/Asana">Asana</a> in San Francisco, CA from 2/21/2021</em></p>
                  <p>We’re looking for the people manager who will design Asana’s design organization and create a great experience for the individual contributors. This person will help make both our design team and our product a dream to work in.<br />
<br />
Asana is going after a huge mission – to help humanity thrive by enabling all teams to work together effortlessly. We’re on a very strong trajectory toward getting there, with organizations like Dropbox, Airbnb, Uber, SimpleHuman, Nest, CERN, the NYC Department of Education, and tens of thousands of others already running their internal communication on Asana. We believe the person who takes this role will end up having a substantial impact on designing the future how teams of humans work together.<br />
<br />
We currently have a team of 7 very talented product designers. What we need is an experienced design leader who can harness that talent and take the product to the next level. Ultimately, great user experience is Asana’s raison d’etre.<br />
<br />
Opportunities to make things better<br />
<br />
This is an opportunity to come into a product and a team that already have traction solving important problems for well-respected customers, and make the product and team far better than they are today.<br />
<br />
The User Experience. While we think there’s no other teamwork product with this much power that’s this simple, we believe that great design leadership will help us express that power in a form that is vastly easier for customers to grok – and more beautiful and delightful.<br />
<br />
On the one hand, customers today love how Asana helps them accomplish more than they could before. They tell us they appreciate that workflows are efficient, interactions are optimized, and the interface affords them a ton of organizational power. On the other hand, many users find Asana’s UI too complicated (and rightfully so), especially as we move further into the mainstream of knowledge workers. We’re excited about the huge opportunity this presents.<br />
<br />
The Team. The Asana design team has a strong bench of raw design talent, with ICs of varying levels of experience. A great design leader can provide the mentorship necessary to elevate each IC to a world-class crafts[wo]man. You will also develop the organization and its processes so that the whole is much more than the sum of its parts, producing a user experience that feels born from a single consistent perspective.</p>

We are extremely self-driven, and do our very best at all times to validate assumptions about our users with various types of testing. <br />
<br />
We are not looking for designers who just want to concentrate on one skill in design, such as user research or visual design --  we need you to be eager to deliver across the entirety of the design process.

You will be working with our IT group on a variety of projects that are both internal and external customer facing, including creating useful experiences with our new personalization engine, building a community portal where customers can help each other, and making our internal tools and processes reflect our commitment to great user experience.<br />
We're expecting you to bring 5+ years of hands-on professional experience as a UX Designer or Interaction Designer, ideally with SaaS or complex web-based enterprise applications. You will be working on projects that discover and resolve problems in Information Architecture and interaction design, and which require strong skills in facilitation and collaboration, relationship building, and driving for outcomes.  The projects will also require the ability to drive user research and do some visual design, based on an existing style guide and component library.</p>

                  <h2><strong>User Experience Lead</strong></h2>
                  <p class="job-meta"><em><a href="/company/Human Practice">Human Practice</a> in Chicago, IL from 2/21/2021</em></p>
                  <p>Human Practice has a strong commitment to design thinking, user research and the design process, and as our next step, we are are searching for a UX lead to support and foster a resilient design culture as a core member of the team here in Chicago.<br />
<br />
Here's how we imagine your first year with us:<br />
<br />
You will take the helm of our user research work and guide the team to give us a deeper, firsthand understanding of our users. Everyone in the company is involved in understanding users, so you will also mentor others to develop everyone's research skills, as well as teach by example.<br />
<br />
You will facilitate the incorporation of user research insights into the everyday actions of our entire team. We want everyone to keep the goals and work of patients, physicians, and medical and administrative staff front of mind as we design and create products.<br />
<br />
Through this work you will develop a clear and focused design vision. You will collaborate with the team to maintain this vision as we iterate on solutions together until they meet user and business goals. You will also be down in the trenches with our developers & visual designer (who might even be you, if that's your thing) to follow through on crafting the product down to the last pixel.<br />
<br />
Because of the bridge you build between our users and our team, patient support communities will love our products. They’ll spread the word about Human Practice, helping more people (new parents, people facing a cancer diagnosis, parents of children with autism, etc.) find good doctors.<br />
<br />
Hospitals will move more quickly to deploy our solutions organization wide to improve their patient experience and to spread the word about the unique people delivering care in their organizations. Your work will lead to healthcare design awards, leaving everyone wondering why no one ever thought to build such a great service sooner.<br />
<br />
In parallel, you will help us to integrate design into all aspects of Human Practice: Our design direction should align with our values, mission, business and culture. Design thinking will have an impact on our working space, how we sell, and how we hire and grow.<br />
<br />
In short, you will rock our world as we enter the next chapter of our growth, and we will be so happy to be working together!</p>

                  <p>As a User Experience Lead, you will be part of a growing team responsible for guiding the vision of UX at Intel. You will interact cross organizationally and have an opportunity to work with really smart and enthusiastic people!<br />
<br />
While this position is not a management role, it is a leadership role. You will be expected to be a UX leader for design and provide direction and guidance to the team. You will act as a key catalyst in driving a culture of teamwork and innovation centered around the needs of our customers.<br />

                  <p class="job-meta"><em><a href="/company/Google">Google</a> in Mountain View, CA from 2/21/2021</em></p>
                  <p>Design and user experience (UX) are at the forefront of everything we do. The job of an Interaction Designer is to envision how people experience our products and bring that vision to life in a way that feels inspired, refined and even magical. In an Interaction Designer role, you’ll tackle complex tasks and transform them into intuitive, accessible and easy-to-use designs for billions of people around the world—from the first-time user to the sophisticated expert. Achieving this goal requires collaboration with teams of Designers, Researchers, Engineers and Product Managers throughout the design process—from creating user flows and wireframes to building user interface mockups and prototypes. At each stage, you will anticipate what our users need, advocate for them and ensure that the final product surprises and delights them.<br />
<br />
These are unique projects that require significant creativity and flexibility from designers. You will be involved in all aspects of design: from early physical and digital explorations through concept prototyping and final pixel-level specification for an experience that spans devices and users. More than anything, an attitude of exploration and openness will lead to success as a Special Projects designer.</p>

Our reach is global and so is our UX focus: you should be excited about the challenge of understanding financial intermediaries in different business models, different countries, and regulatory environments. It’s a brave new world and we need someone who can be adaptive and resilient, able to change courses quickly, and focus on the customer while continuing to move solutions forward efficiently. </p>

Achieving this goal requires collaboration with teams of other Designers, Researchers, Engineers and Product Managers throughout the design process - from creating user flows and wireframes, to building user interface mockups and prototypes. At each stage, you will anticipate what our users need, advocate for them, and ensure that the final product surprises and delights them.<br />
