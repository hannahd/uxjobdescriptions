                  <h2><strong>Senior UX Researcher</strong></h2>
                  <p class="job-meta"><em><a href="/company/Amazon">Amazon</a> in Seattle, WA from 2/21/2021</em></p>
                  <p>Amazon's Kindle Ads Product team is seeking a talented and passionate user experience researcher. This researcher will have a significant impact on our business executing innovative, influential user research that shapes the customer experience for a growing tablet ad industry. The researcher will work collaboratively with product managers, executives, designers, data scientists, and other researchers across Amazon to help drive the vision for increasing customer engagement with our ad products.<br />
<br />
As a User Experience Researcher studying the tablet ad experience, you’ll use a variety of lab and field research techniques to help create and validate new features. This is a leadership role that requires the ability to influence others and to work with minimal direction. We’re looking for a strong and vocal user advocate with excellent communication skills. The ideal candidate will have a deep knowledge of different user research methodologies, past experience with UX research in either advertising or e-commerce, and the ability to innovate new approaches when appropriate.</p>

                  <p class="job-meta"><em><a href="/company/Atlassian">Atlassian</a> in Sydney, Australia from 2/21/2021</em></p>
                  <p>Do you have a drive for finding out why people do the things they do with software products, and how those products could be improved? And do you get a kick out of putting research practices in place for everyone to use?<br />
<br />
At Atlassian we develop products in cross-disciplinary teams that are united in wanting to provide the best experience for customers we can. We believe in investing in continual customer research to inform our thinking and our design. Research at Atlassian asks the tough questions, and works with teams to answer those questions. In this role you will investigate what our customers need and return actionable insights, grow and scale research as an integrated discipline at Atlassian, work with teams to define hypotheses and success measures, and conduct whatever research is necessary to ensure we achieve those measures.<br />
<br />
Being a researcher at Atlassian<br />
<br />
Research at Atlassian ensures there are not only eyes on what our customers think and say about our products (and do in our products), but a way to turn results into action. Research is employed throughout our process, from early stage concepts and ideation, through to implementation, ongoing improvement and customer support. We're dedicated to agile methodology and are believers in 'lean', which means we despise documentation for documentation's sake. We are extremely self-driven, and do our very best at all times to validate assumptions about our customers.<br />
<br />
We need a researcher who knows how to work out the right research to do at the right time, with the communication and persuasion skills to educate everyone about what that research means for them, and to help them take ownership of implementing whatever the impact of that research is. Atlassian is growing, and it's important that research doesn't belong to a few, but is scaled throughout the company with the right tools, training and techniques. We also have a thriving growth hacking team who run ongoing experiments to optimise usability and usefulness of our products; it's important that you know how to integrate results from various research and testing programs into a coherent truthful story.<br />

The goal of the User Experience team (UX) is to improve the user experience by incorporating research, insights and content strategy into the product cycle. As a UX Researcher, you will work closely with product teams throughout the design process to identify opportunities for research, choose the appropriate methods, conduct the research and analyze and present results. Your toolbox should consist of both qualitative and quantitative methods, such as expert reviews, user tests, and journal studies, as well as experiments, surveys and A/B testing. (Experience with log analysis or statistical analysis is a plus.) As a partner to product design teams, you should have strong communication skills, drawing on your experience with design to describe and sometimes mock-up suggestions in research reports. While your main focus as a UX Researcher will be to investigate specific products and interfaces and work closely with product design teams, we also focus on larger usability and content issues across the site. As a result, you should have a strong understanding of social media, good product instincts, a creative approach to research design, and a bold, entrepreneurial attitude.</p>
