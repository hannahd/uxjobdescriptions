                  <p>At Google, we follow a simple but vital premise: "Focus on the user and all else will follow." Google’s Visual Designers weave space, typography, color, iconography, and texture together to help people successfully navigate our products. We believe that all of our products should be beautiful and accessible.<br />
<br />
Google User Experience (UX) is made up of multi-disciplinary teams of UX Designers, Researchers, Writers, Content Strategists, Program Managers, and Engineers: we care deeply about the people who use our products. The UX team plays an integral part in gathering insights about the behaviors and perceptions of people who use our products to inspire and inform design. We collaborate closely with each other and with engineering and product management to create industry-leading products that deliver value for the people who use them, and for Google’s businesses.<br />
<br />
As a Visual Designer, you’ll rely on user-centered design methods to craft industry-leading user experiences—from concept to execution. Like all of our UX jobs, you’ll collaborate with your design partners to leverage and evolve the Google design language to build beautiful, innovative, inspired products that people love to use.</p>

We believe that all of our products should be beautiful and accessible. As a Visual Designer, you’ll delight users with designs that inspire, engage and excite them.  You’ll rely on user-centered design principles to produce high-quality visuals—from concept to execution—across many platforms. Like all of our UX jobs, you’ll collaborate with your fellow designers to constantly refine the Google design language and create innovative, great-looking products that people love to use.<br />
<br />
As a Visual Designer focusing on Google's Android mobile platform you will work closely with engineers and product managers throughout all stages of the product cycle to create compelling, coherent and user friendly designs. Top candidates will be critical thinkers with the ability to express concepts verbally and visually and refine them through to final production artwork. Successful candidates will be able to have an impact on the mobile experience of millions of Android users.<br />

                  <p>Foursquare is seeking a passionate, curious, and thoughtful designer to join our Product Experience & Design Team. We believe we're changing the way people experience the world around them, and we want someone who's eager to play a huge role in defining how. We work as a tight, cross-disciplinary team, so you need to feel comfortable working closely with a variety of teams, as well as your fellow designers, to evolve the product and the brand across our mobile clients.<br />
<br />
As a designer, you will be involved in every aspect of the product development process – from brainstorming the next feature – to tweaking pixels right up to code freeze if necessary. <br />
<br />
You never make a design decision without considering the impact on the overall experience. You're comfortable quickly iterating your way to a final, well-thought-out solution. You know how to articulate the rationale behind every design decision you make, and you know how to ask the right questions. You also know how to toe the line between practical and playful. </p>

                  <p class="job-meta"><em><a href="/company/Booking">Booking</a> in Amsterdam Netherlands from 2/21/2021</em></p>
                  <p>Our guiding principle is that by helping our users we help our business.

About You<br />
‘Designer’ is just what it says on your CV - you’d be just as happy to be labeled an Engineer, or Analyst; a Builder, Hacker or Maker. Because what you really do, what you live for, is solving problems. Your portfolio isn’t a series of beautiful but generic templates - it’s a collection of stories that you can discuss with enthusiasm, and regret ... because you’re always getting better at what you do and you’re never satisfied with ‘good enough.’. You’re equally comfortable discussing colour theory, user psychology, or the semantic implications of the DIV tag, you're a writer of excellent HTML & CSS. You’re excited about the endless potential of the web, and being able to build things that millions of people can use every day.</p>
