I"¿<p>You have a passion for complex problems and tools. We do not work on Spotifyâ€™s public-facing apps or marketing; we build internal tools for other Spotifiers. Itâ€™s crucial that you are excited by this. The rewards come from getting to solve real problems for your colleagues and from having the liberty to move fast and innovate. On our team, designers also have the opportunity to work across multiple teams/products<br />
You have skills/interest in both UX and UI design. You will be doing user research to understand the general problem space, designing overall interaction flows, and also executing fine-grained interface work<br />
You get excited about data. Spotify has amazing data, and we work with it heavily. To make our data useful for other Spotifiers, we need to be able to explore and understand it ourselves. Itâ€™s not a hard requirement that you can query or analyze data, but you should have experience working with data-focused applications or data storytelling, and you should have a lot of zeal for diving into this problem space<br />
You are great at collaborating. Working on engineering-focused teams, usually as the only designer, means you have to be a great collaborator and communicator.<br />
You are able to understand engineering goals and problems, and to persuade engineers of the goals and processes of design. You should be comfortable with working within an agile structure that is usually more geared toward engineering.</p>
