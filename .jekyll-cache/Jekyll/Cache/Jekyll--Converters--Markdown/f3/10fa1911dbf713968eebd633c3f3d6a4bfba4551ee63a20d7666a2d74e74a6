I"¼<p>You have at least 7+ years of experience in a similar role at consumer-focused product companies; experience designing for multiple platforms is a huge plus.<br />
You are an incredible designer with amazing design chops. Youâ€™ve shipped many consumer products/features over the years and are equally skilled at interaction and visual design; bonus skills include motion design and prototyping skills.<br />
You have an aptitude for translating and documenting design ideas into visuals that can be shared with all parts of the business.<br />
You possess a strong understanding of usability and user experience principles.<br />
You take calculated risks: youâ€™re comfortable with designing to learn, unafraid of making mistakes (because they are a part of learning), and can temper your analytical skills with intuition and creative ambition.<br />
You have the communication skills to help set up frameworks and brainstorm initial design concepts. Also instrumental is the ability to speak confidently to your own design work and convince others of your reasoning.<br />
You have an online portfolio, or PDF that you can share with us. Applications without a portfolio are unlikely to be considered.</p>
