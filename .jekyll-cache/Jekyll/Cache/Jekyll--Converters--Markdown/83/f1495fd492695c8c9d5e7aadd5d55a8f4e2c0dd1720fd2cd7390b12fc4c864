â€¢	Collaborates on his/her design to get early feedback from stakeholders<br />
â€¢	Iterative mentality to take regular feedback and incorporate it quickly into regular sprint releases. <br />
â€¢	Must be able to accept input and incorporate as needed. <br />
â€¢	Must be able to articulate value proposition of one approach over another, when design concepts conflict with user or business unit desires<br />
â€¢	Understand driving factors/features to influence design concepts. <br />
â€¢	Provide tools that are easy to use (ie no instruction manual or tutorial required), seamless across platforms (ie various mobile devices), common UX/UI (ie will create tools and apps that co-exist together) and provides meaningful value to the customer<br />
â€¢	Partners with developers<br />
â€¢	Prototypes should be intuitive for users (ie no training or userâ€™s manual required) and efficient (minimize interactions needed to meet objective of the page or process, no duplicative data entry, etc)<br />
â€¢	Sketches, models, prototypes - whatever it takes to clearly communicate design<br />
Process <br />
â€¢	Determine correct metrics, direct collection of such metrics, and report upon them <br />
â€¢	Analyze risk at each stage and report potential problems meeting system requirements <br />
â€¢	Understand role at each stage of the development life cycle <br />
â€¢	Ability to communicate up, down and across</p>
