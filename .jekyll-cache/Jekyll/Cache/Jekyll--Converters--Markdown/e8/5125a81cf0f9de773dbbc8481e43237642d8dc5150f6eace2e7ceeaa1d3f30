I"ê<p>Familiarity with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the technologies that you‚Äôre designing for is kinda useful, a lot, actually.<br />
<br />
Experience with versioning, SVN, or preferably Git‚Ä¶ would be unbelievably awesome (but not required, we are just reaching for the gold here)<br />
<br />
Experience with e-commerce and local business<br />
<br />
Experience working with Ruby on Rails and jQuery? That is just icing-on-the-cake! (you are a monster by the way)<br />
<br />
Familiarity with quantitative testing methodologies: A/B testing, log analysis, and other forms of data-driven design‚Ä¶ as that is what invariably happens to your output!</p>
