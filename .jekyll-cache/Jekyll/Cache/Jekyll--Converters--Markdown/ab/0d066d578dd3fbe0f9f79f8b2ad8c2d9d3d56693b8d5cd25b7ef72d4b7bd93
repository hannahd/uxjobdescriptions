I"“<p>Top designs kills with a portfolio to prove it.<br />
Youâ€™ve designed native apps for both iOS and Android.<br />
Apply the gamut of skills in product, interaction, and visual design to help create &amp; build new features of Vineâ€™s mobile and web apps.<br />
Stay on the pulse and contribute ideas for new features or ways to improve whatâ€™s already there.<br />
You get a huge kick out of getting and giving feedback, both internal and external (from users and data)<br />
This is serious business, so it ainâ€™t all design â€“ youâ€™ll work intimately with developers, product managers, marketers and all disciplines involved in putting out a global product.<br />
The chance to hand your work off to your complement in another discipline takes trust, and you understand what it takes to get there and keep those relationships running smoothly.<br />
You can speak not jus passionately about your design work, you can speak plainly about it to anyone.<br />
You explore many ideas at once, without spending too long on any one concept.<br />
You donâ€™t fetishize static mocks, and understand the importance of motion and prototyping.<br />
Thereâ€™s a deadline for everything, and while we at Vine are unrelenting perfectionists, you know when itâ€™s time to let your baby go out into the world.<br />
Itâ€™s not a failure, itâ€™s experience! You learn from mistakes and misfires and come back stronger for it.</p>
