I"º<p>THE DETAILS MATTER TO YOU.
Youâ€™ve spent your career slaving over letter spacing and corner rounding. You canâ€™t not bump that object 2px to the left just to get it right. You are a walking encyclopedia of microinteractions in use (on mobile, web, desktop, etc), and have nuanced views on how to make many of them even better.</p>

<p>YOU DO MORE THAN JUST MAKE IT PRETTY.
You design beautiful UI, and you realize beauty only gets you so far. You actively participate in all aspects of the product design process. You have opinions beyond just the look and feel. You are deeply passionate about how the pieces fit together to create the best experience.</p>

<p>YOU ARE INCREDIBLY PRODUCTIVE.
You deliver twice the quality in half the time. You mastered the Creative Suite years ago. You geek out on keyboard shortcuts, Photoshop actions, and the newest prototyping tools. You constantly strive to optimize your workflow, increase your output, and become a more efficient and effective designer.</p>

<p>YOUâ€™VE SHIPPED BEST-IN-CLASS PRODUCTS.
Youâ€™ve weathered release cycles and know what details matter at each stage, you document and motivate engineers to get the fit and finish right. You can share several shining examples of real work youâ€™ve shipped, and what you learned along the way.</p>

<p>YOU ARE A STORYTELLER.
You know that design alone is not enough to make a product successful. You craft stories within the product to make the experience more relevant and human. You tell stories to teammates to sell your ideas, provide context, and make design more compelling.</p>

<p>YOU CAN THINK AND TALK ABOUT THE BOTTOM LINE.
Analytics donâ€™t scare you, and you know which features can act as force multipliers on your companyâ€™s business model.</p>

<p>PROTOTYPING IS A KEY PART OF YOUR TOOLSET.
Youâ€™ve prototyped on multiple platforms. Youâ€™ve made last-minute tweaks between user studies. You know how to be all kinds of quick and dirty, but dream of better prototyping tools.</p>

<p>CROSS-PLATFORM IS YOUR STYLE.
Hopefully youâ€™ve shipped something across several platforms. You know what translates from desktop and what doesnâ€™t, or why youâ€™d opt for one solution for iOS and another on Android.</p>
