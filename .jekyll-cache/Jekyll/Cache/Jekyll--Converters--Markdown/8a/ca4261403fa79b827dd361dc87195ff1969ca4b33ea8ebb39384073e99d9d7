I"Q<p>Top designs kills with a portfolio to prove it.
You’ve designed native apps for both iOS and Android.
Apply the gamut of skills in product, interaction, and visual design to help create &amp; build new features of Vine’s mobile and web apps.
Stay on the pulse and contribute ideas for new features or ways to improve what’s already there.
You get a huge kick out of getting and giving feedback, both internal and external (from users and data)
This is serious business, so it ain’t all design – you’ll work intimately with developers, product managers, marketers and all disciplines involved in putting out a global product.
The chance to hand your work off to your complement in another discipline takes trust, and you understand what it takes to get there and keep those relationships running smoothly.
You can speak not jus passionately about your design work, you can speak plainly about it to anyone.
You explore many ideas at once, without spending too long on any one concept.
You don’t fetishize static mocks, and understand the importance of motion and prototyping.
There’s a deadline for everything, and while we at Vine are unrelenting perfectionists, you know when it’s time to let your baby go out into the world.
It’s not a failure, it’s experience! You learn from mistakes and misfires and come back stronger for it.</p>
