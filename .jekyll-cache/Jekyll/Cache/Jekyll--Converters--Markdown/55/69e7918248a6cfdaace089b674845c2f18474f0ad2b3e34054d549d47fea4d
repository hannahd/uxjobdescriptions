I"X<p>Passion about Slack and the problems we’re solving.<br />
5-8+ years of experience leading major product initiatives across consumer or direct-to-customer business products. You can take rough themes and big ideas and turn them into a roadmap of features, experiments, and research with minimal guidance.<br />
Impact focus and a consistent history of delivering measurable results for both users and the business.<br />
Ability to think big and small to build a portfolio of experiments and larger features. You are as comfortable whiteboarding a completely new experience as you are optimizing an existing flow and know when to do which. You can initiate and drive multiple projects concurrently. <br />
Impeccable follow-through. You say what you’ll do, and do what you say. You hold your team to this standard. You don’t let details slip.<br />
Must be a self-motivated team player and able to work in fast-paced environments with minimal oversight.<br />
Data and business-minded. You deeply understand how your products work and how to measure long-term impact. You can design, run, and interpret experiments and A/B tests. You understand the impact your work has on the business.<br />
Product sense and craftsmanship. You will own important product interactions with every Slack customer, and should show the attention to detail this responsibility deserves.<br />
You listen well. You build consensus by default, but can drive hard decisions when needed. You push the pace. You take blame and pass on praise. People love working with you.<br />
Written communication that is clear and effective.<br /></p>
