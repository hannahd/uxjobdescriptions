I"|<p>Familiarity with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the technologies that you’re designing for is kinda useful, a lot, actually.</p>

<p>Experience with versioning, SVN, or preferably Git… would be unbelievably awesome (but not required, we are just reaching for the gold here)</p>

<p>Experience with e-commerce and local business</p>

<p>Experience working with Ruby on Rails and jQuery? That is just icing-on-the-cake! (you are a monster by the way)</p>

<p>Familiarity with quantitative testing methodologies: A/B testing, log analysis, and other forms of data-driven design… as that is what invariably happens to your output!</p>
