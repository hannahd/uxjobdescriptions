I",<p>We follow a simple but vital premise in the User Experience group “Focus on the user and all else will follow.” We’re passionately interested in our users and strive to learn everything we can about their goals and needs, attitudes and emotions to help define the products and experiences we create. <br />
<br />
The User Experience team is a critical driving force behind gathering these insights and then using them to inspire and inform design. We are a multi-disciplinary team of interaction designers, visual designers, user researchers, copywriters and web developers who collaborate closely with each other and with Engineering and Product Management to create innovative, usable, great-looking products that people love to use.<br />
<br />
As a User Experience Research Recruiter, you’ll have the opportunity to support research activities that aim to develop innovative, user-friendly, best-of-breed products. You have strong organizational and analytical skills, excellent communication skills, and a knack for assessment of human behavior.</p>
