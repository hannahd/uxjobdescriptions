I"0<p>As a Sr. Designer, you’ll be asked to do more than just create design comps, interactions and specs (though you’ll have to do a lot of that!). You’ll also be asked to lead teams of other user experience pros, product managers, and business managers to conceptualize and deliver amazing solutions to complex and shifting problems. You’ll support your recommendations with competitive audits and research. And, because all good design is iterative, you’ll be eager to present your concepts for constant internal and partner review and critique.</p>
