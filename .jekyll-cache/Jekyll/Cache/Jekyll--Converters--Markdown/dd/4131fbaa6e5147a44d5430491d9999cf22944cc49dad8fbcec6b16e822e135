I"(<p>A strong portfolio is absolutely critical for this role, both in terms of demonstrating your experience and as an example of your ability to create a compelling design presentation. Your portfolio should showcase your experience in UX and interaction design, particularly where simplicity and ease of use were a major concern. Weâ€™d like to see a diversity of projects and a solid collection of outcomes and deliverables (flows, mockups, and prototypes), and be sure the portfolio demonstrates the design and thought process behind each image.</p>
