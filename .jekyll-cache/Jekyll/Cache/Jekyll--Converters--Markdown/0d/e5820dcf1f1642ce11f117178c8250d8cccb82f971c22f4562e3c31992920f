I"õ<p>Seriously collaborative, even with people not on our teams<br />
Work on the next generation of applications for mobile devices and new/emerging technology (your work will go live in the manufacturer application stores and be seen by millions!)<br />
Daily product decision making and real product delivery with product managers and developers<br />
Freedom to try out new design processes; in the spirit of agile, do what works, try new things, stop doing things that don‚Äôt work; not a lot of constraints on the ‚Äúcreative‚Äù process<br />
Environment that encourages learning and growing as a professional and individual; and infrastructure to support and motivate those goals<br />
Community-oriented design team<br />
All the designers have different skillsets: you‚Äôre not expected to be an expert in everything but having access to someone who probably is means we all get smarter by teaching and learning</p>
