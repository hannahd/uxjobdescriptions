I"ž<p>Uber has already found strong product/market fit with its world-changing service.  But it is absolutely day one for us. Weâ€™re seeking a small group of unbelievably talented and thoughtful designers to define and execute against a giant vision that builds upon what Uber has brought to the world so far.  <br />
If you have the right stuff to join the Uber London team, youâ€™ll work members of city operations team in a fast-paced, rapidly growing, hybrid (technology/operations) environment.<br />
We are highly customer-centric and we deeply believe we can innovate our way out of any box.  The role demands self management, great execution, quick turnarounds, bold innovation, obsession with quality, fearlessness, and optimism. Ideal candidates will be inspired by the unknown and never settle, solving problems with creativity while keeping the customer in mind and ambition to take projects to the finish line.</p>
