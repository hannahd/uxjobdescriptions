I"à<p>Weâ€™re expecting you to bring 10+ years of hands-on professional experience as a designer and 5+ years of experience leading and managing a team. You enjoy leading people, but have the urge to get your hands back into the design from time to time. Youâ€™re a no-bullshit communicator who listens carefully and communicates clearly. You strive for simplicity on the far side of complexity and you have a track record of shipping simple and beautiful products.<br />
