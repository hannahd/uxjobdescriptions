I"<p>We are looking for a charismatic and visionary design director to lead the Instagram design team. Instagram is a collaborative environment between engineering, product management, and design, a culture where ideas can be sparked by any individual but cannot be realized without a collective effort. As the leader of the design team, your responsibilities go far beyond simple aesthetics: you will coach both engineering and design to empathize with the user and build beautiful, usable experiences that make the ordinary seem extraordinary. You will define the creative process from start to finish, own the responsibility for delivering the highest quality product with your team of talented designers, and be the design visionary for future Instagram products.</p>
