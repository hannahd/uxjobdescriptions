I"z<p>Internalize and deeply understand Uber’s mission and strategies; play key role in translating into product strategy<br />
Manage, coach and lead a team of highly technical Product Managers and, later (as the team continues to scale), Group Product Managers.  Ensure strong team dynamics, team + individual team member performance, growth and #superpumpedness.  <br />
Distill vision and strategy for the team, and ensure coherence across teams and initiatives.<br />
Relentlessly recruit the best product, engineering and design talent in the industry<br />
Be in the details.  Know your team’s work in depth; get your hands dirty a lot.<br />
Interface with other functional areas (Engineering, Business Development, Operations, Legal, etc.) to ensure efficient and productive working relationships.<br />
Lead by example.  Be incredibly truth-seeking and finger-tippy with data, set a high bar for the team to think boldly and creatively and then to funnel that energy into concrete products and execution plans, move fast, be biased toward action.<br />
Drive team to set and achieve qualitative objectives and quantitative goals with their Program teams<br />
Contribute materially to innovation, definition, deliverables planning (roadmap), design and go-to-market planning of entirely new Uber products and product features to deliver against team and company goals.  <br />
Monitor and measure launched products and feed learnings back into product development process.<br />
Clearly communicate product plans, benefits and results, as appropriate, to a spectrum of audiences, from internal stakeholders to all Uber employees to customers.</p>
