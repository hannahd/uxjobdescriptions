I"Þ<p>The Innovation Designer role is for a visionary artist who can create illustrative concepts from broad ranging concepts. This position will be a member of the innovation team and will visualize concepts in an iterative design approach. These concepts will be represented from storyboard format to wireframe to mockup (low-res, hi-res) to prototype design. The goal of the innovation designer is to enable the product owner to get a visual sense of what is being proposed early in the process and on a regular basis.
The designer will stay one (1) sprint cycle ahead of the developers so that visual and functional concepts can be refined prior to coding. Functional mock-ups are a valuable tool that this position will create.</p>
