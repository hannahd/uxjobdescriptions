I"™<p>Twitter is looking for a designer to work on products and experiences
for our TV &amp; Video related initiatives. Youâ€™ll work with engineering
and product teams to build an intuitive, powerful platform that serves
multinational brands, small businesses, and everyone in between.
Youâ€™ll also be thinking about ads and commerce experiences that
enhance, rather than detract from, Twitter for both businesses and
consumers, while working with people across the company to make it
happen. You care about building tools that help people achieve their
goals easily, whether on desktop or mobile, and you have an interest
in data exploration and visualization.</p>
