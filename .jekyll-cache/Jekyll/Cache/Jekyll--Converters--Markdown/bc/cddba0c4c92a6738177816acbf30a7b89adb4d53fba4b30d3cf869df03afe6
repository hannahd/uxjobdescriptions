I"u<p>Greenhouse is looking to hire our first Visual Designer.</p>

<p>We’re looking for an experienced designer to help us elevate our visual style and execute a branding system across all of our touch points, both print and digital.</p>

<p>We’re looking for someone who can translate our brand to marketing and sales materials as well as execute on small functionality details (work flows, permission levels, etc.) within the product itself.</p>

<p>Being a designer at Greenhouse means an opportunity to help define an entire enterprise product and practice UX/interaction design at the highest level of complexity. One of the biggest challenges will be to simplify and communicate functionality - but also to frame the entire product in a way that influences how hiring teams do their job.</p>

<p>Crucially, we’re looking for someone who is excited about the tremendous opportunity of bringing the consideration and playfulness of consumer design to the enterprise.  We pride ourselves on building thoughtful software for real people and genuinely enjoy the challenge of designing the digital tools people use to do their job.</p>
