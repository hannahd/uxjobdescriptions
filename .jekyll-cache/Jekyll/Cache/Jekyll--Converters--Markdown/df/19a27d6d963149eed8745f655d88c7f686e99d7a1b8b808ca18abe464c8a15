I"Ü<p>Collaborate well. You donâ€™t hesitate to talk, sketch, whiteboard, or prototype to get your idea across. You also know when to listen and when to let go of an idea so an even better one can start to form.<br />
Understand the impact that your design will have on the people developing our technical future.<br />
Will settle for nothing less than user-centric design. You represent the user in product and engineering meetings. You test your ideas out with user tests and embrace rapid feedback loops.<br />
Enjoy systems. You have a burning desire to map a userâ€™s workflow and then wireframe (or code) a prototype derived from that.<br />
Have a sense of humor and enjoy working with intense, smart teams of designers, developers, and product managers.<br />
Are flexible. Priorities change, teams change, but process can be the flexible thread that keeps the project on track.<br />
Are kind. Itâ€™s one of our Main Principles.<br />
Want to continually learn and grow.<br /></p>
