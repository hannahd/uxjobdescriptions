I"²	<p>Weâ€™re looking for the people manager who will design Asanaâ€™s design organization and create a great experience for the individual contributors. This person will help make both our design team and our product a dream to work in.<br />
<br />
Asana is going after a huge mission â€“ to help humanity thrive by enabling all teams to work together effortlessly. Weâ€™re on a very strong trajectory toward getting there, with organizations like Dropbox, Airbnb, Uber, SimpleHuman, Nest, CERN, the NYC Department of Education, and tens of thousands of others already running their internal communication on Asana. We believe the person who takes this role will end up having a substantial impact on designing the future how teams of humans work together.<br />
<br />
We currently have a team of 7 very talented product designers. What we need is an experienced design leader who can harness that talent and take the product to the next level. Ultimately, great user experience is Asanaâ€™s raison dâ€™etre.<br />
<br />
Opportunities to make things better<br />
<br />
This is an opportunity to come into a product and a team that already have traction solving important problems for well-respected customers, and make the product and team far better than they are today.<br />
<br />
The User Experience. While we think thereâ€™s no other teamwork product with this much power thatâ€™s this simple, we believe that great design leadership will help us express that power in a form that is vastly easier for customers to grok â€“ and more beautiful and delightful.<br />
<br />
On the one hand, customers today love how Asana helps them accomplish more than they could before. They tell us they appreciate that workflows are efficient, interactions are optimized, and the interface affords them a ton of organizational power. On the other hand, many users find Asanaâ€™s UI too complicated (and rightfully so), especially as we move further into the mainstream of knowledge workers. Weâ€™re excited about the huge opportunity this presents.<br />
<br />
The Team. The Asana design team has a strong bench of raw design talent, with ICs of varying levels of experience. A great design leader can provide the mentorship necessary to elevate each IC to a world-class crafts[wo]man. You will also develop the organization and its processes so that the whole is much more than the sum of its parts, producing a user experience that feels born from a single consistent perspective.</p>
