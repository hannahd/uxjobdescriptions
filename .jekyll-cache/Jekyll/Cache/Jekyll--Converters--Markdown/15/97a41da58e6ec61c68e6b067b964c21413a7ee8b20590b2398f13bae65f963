I"<p>We’re expecting you to bring 7+ years’ hands-on professional experience as a UX Researcher, ideally with SaaS or complex web-based enterprise applications. A degree in Psychology or 5+ years’ professional experience involving Organisational Psychology is favourable. You’ll be relied upon to formulate the right research strategies to undertake in various projects, as well as supporting others in carrying out those strategies, so you’ll need a strong understanding of user research techniques. You’ll be tackling tough challenges that will need to combine business-, technical- and user experience priorities, which requires strong skills in prioritization, facilitation and collaboration, relationship building, and driving for outcomes.<br />
<br />
The analysis and insights generated will need to be folded into various concept work, and explained at various levels in the company - from engineers through to the CEOs - so you will need strong communication skills, and to be always thinking of innovative ways to show those insights in action, not just talking about them. The role will work closely with UX Designers responsible for interface design, visual design and prototyping, so skills in conceptual modeling, UX design and prototyping are favorable.</p>
