I"^<p>Our UX team is responsible for knowing and championing excellence in our customers’ digital experience. You should be passionate about understanding user journeys and needs, able to design and conduct inquiries to discover and inform, design web solutions to serve them, and conduct studies and evaluations to validate the work. Our marketing landscape is multi-channel and you should be equally at home in desktop websites, tablets, and smartphones. Our reach is global and so is our UX focus: you should be excited about the challenge of understanding financial intermediaries in different business models, different countries, and regulatory environments. It’s a brave new world and we need someone who can be adaptive and resilient, able to change courses quickly, and focus on the customer while continuing to move solutions forward efficiently.</p>
