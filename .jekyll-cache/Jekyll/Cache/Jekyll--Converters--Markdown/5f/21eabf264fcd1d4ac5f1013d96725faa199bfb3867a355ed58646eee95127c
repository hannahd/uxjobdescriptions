I"œ<p>Do you have a drive for finding out why people do the things they do with software products, and how those products could be improved? And do you get a kick out of putting research practices in place for everyone to use?</p>

<p>At Atlassian we develop products in cross-disciplinary teams that are united in wanting to provide the best experience for customers we can. We believe in investing in continual customer research to inform our thinking and our design. Research at Atlassian asks the tough questions, and works with teams to answer those questions. In this role you will investigate what our customers need and return actionable insights, grow and scale research as an integrated discipline at Atlassian, work with teams to define hypotheses and success measures, and conduct whatever research is necessary to ensure we achieve those measures.</p>

<p>Being a researcher at Atlassian</p>

<p>Research at Atlassian ensures there are not only eyes on what our customers think and say about our products (and do in our products), but a way to turn results into action. Research is employed throughout our process, from early stage concepts and ideation, through to implementation, ongoing improvement and customer support. Weâ€™re dedicated to agile methodology and are believers in â€˜leanâ€™, which means we despise documentation for documentationâ€™s sake. We are extremely self-driven, and do our very best at all times to validate assumptions about our customers.</p>

<p>We need a researcher who knows how to work out the right research to do at the right time, with the communication and persuasion skills to educate everyone about what that research means for them, and to help them take ownership of implementing whatever the impact of that research is. Atlassian is growing, and itâ€™s important that research doesnâ€™t belong to a few, but is scaled throughout the company with the right tools, training and techniques. We also have a thriving growth hacking team who run ongoing experiments to optimise usability and usefulness of our products; itâ€™s important that you know how to integrate results from various research and testing programs into a coherent truthful story.</p>
