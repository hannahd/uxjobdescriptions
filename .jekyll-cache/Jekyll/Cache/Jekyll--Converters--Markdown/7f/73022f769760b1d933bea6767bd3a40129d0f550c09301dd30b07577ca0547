I"å<p>Create new designs, including (but not limited to) user flows, wireframes, mocks, and prototypes.<br />
Communicate design intent to both internal and external teams. Clearly rationalize and justify design work and advocate for usersâ€™ needs.<br />
Collaborate effectively on a team and be willing to explore all options. Design is grounded in constraints, which serve as boundaries to work within and barriers to creatively overcome. The craft is knowing when to conform and when to push the edge.<br />
Work closely with user researchers to better inform designs through usersâ€™ point of view.<br />
Deliver the designs for each release by following through on details with the Engineering team and driving fit-and-finish polish.</p>
