I" <p>We believe great design comes from fusing the art and science of design, but both are rarely found within a single individual. We prefer to create a team with some people specializing in the art of design and others in the science of design. For this particular role, we need a visual designer with expertise in the art of design; an individual who can channel his/her passion for design excellence to deliver solutions inspired by a deep desire to create emotionally compelling branded experiences.</p>

<p>We work collaboratively to produce and ship real products. To that end, we need a team player who can turn a variety of requirements into clear and simple solutions. We need you, if you are driven by a passion for great visual design; a designer who can channel that passion to deliver solutions that are creatively inspired and pragmatically realized. We need you, if you are a humble expert; if you can effectively engage in projects from concept to production, nail the details, and enjoy learning from and collaborating with other designers, software engineers, product managers, and marketing to deliver compelling experiences.</p>

<p>Does any of this resonate with you? If so, then consider joining our UX team. We’re a small team that’s highly experienced, at the table, and impactful</p>
