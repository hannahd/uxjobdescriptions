I"R<p>Working across all our brands, designing both web and mobile solutions, the Shutterfly User Experience team creates compelling solutions to enable others to transform memories into beautiful gifts and keepsakes.
We are looking for a passionate designer who can collaborate with product management and engineering on broad, complex problems that require outstanding practical experience and theoretical knowledge of both design as well as business.
We are seeking designers who energetically sketchâ€”both on paper and white boards, as a means of rapidly exploring and prototyping ideas with colleagues on cross-functional teams. We are looking for people who are inquisitive, humble, optimistic, collaborative, empathetic and creative. We want people who can pursue multiple paths equally, who love design but are not in love with their own designs. All our designers must be able to conceptualize innovative designs, and create user experience specifications, workflows and mockups. Provide expert evaluation of intangibles as well as develop well-crafted design artifacts and specifications. We do not want gunslingers that simply apply established patterns, but rather people who will dig in to understand the underlying issues.
The Lead UX Designer is a highly visible and exciting role within the organization, the expectation is that you should be able to evangelize your ideas and provide leadership for the overall design vision and execution of your products. This role is expected to make significant contributions to organizational objectives directly affecting the user experience and our products.</p>
