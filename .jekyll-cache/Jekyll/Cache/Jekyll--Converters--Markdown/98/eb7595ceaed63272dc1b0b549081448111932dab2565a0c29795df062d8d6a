I"à<p>Your core responsibility will be in combining your knowledge and expertise with the goals of our business to deliver a world-class user experience to our diverse, loyal user-base. Youâ€™ll be comfortable taking a data-led approach to design. You will be a passionate advocate for the user, dedicated to the craft of design and excited about working in an agile, collaborative environment.<br />

<ul>
  <li>Simplicity: Good design is invisible.<br /></li>
  <li>Collaboration: Youâ€™ll be working alongside developers and copywriters to create elegant user experiences; you should thrive on feedback, critique and iteration.<br /></li>
  <li>Visual Design: Photoshop, Fireworks, Keynote, MS Paint - whatever works for you. Your process is your own; you get to decide which tools you use.<br /></li>
  <li>HTML/CSS: Youâ€™ll be given full ownership of your ideas, and so youâ€™ll be required to both create beautiful mockups/wireframes/prototypes - and implement them.</li>
