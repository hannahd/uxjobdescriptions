I"><p>Design and user experience are incredibly important at WalmartLabs. We look to the principal to envision how to help people save money and live better with Walmart, and to bring that vision to life. <br />
Principals are responsible for setting the vision for global ecommerce product launches in Asia Pacific, Europe and the Americas that require the integration of multiple systems and APIs. Principals create the plans that are used by other team members to develop the user interface, content, and functionality. To do this you’ll use your extensive knowledge of the UX process (research, conceptual design, prototyping, testing) to lead and collaborate with other architects, designers, content strategists, researchers, product managers and engineers.<br />
You will be responsible for consulting with internal clients about their business goals, and proposing front-end architectural solutions and strategies that meet both users’ and business needs. <br />
You love to solve complex problems and mentor and lead others who feel the same, and your solutions merge with a larger structure to create a cohesive design ecosystem.<br />
When you look at Walmart.com, you see multiple easy ways we could make the experience easier and more delightful for our customer – and you’re excited to tell us about them.<br />
