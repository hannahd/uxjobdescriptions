I""	<p>Human Practice has a strong commitment to design thinking, user research and the design process, and as our next step, we are are searching for a UX lead to support and foster a resilient design culture as a core member of the team here in Chicago.</p>

<p>Here’s how we imagine your first year with us:</p>

<p>You will take the helm of our user research work and guide the team to give us a deeper, firsthand understanding of our users. Everyone in the company is involved in understanding users, so you will also mentor others to develop everyone’s research skills, as well as teach by example.</p>

<p>You will facilitate the incorporation of user research insights into the everyday actions of our entire team. We want everyone to keep the goals and work of patients, physicians, and medical and administrative staff front of mind as we design and create products.</p>

<p>Through this work you will develop a clear and focused design vision. You will collaborate with the team to maintain this vision as we iterate on solutions together until they meet user and business goals. You will also be down in the trenches with our developers &amp; visual designer (who might even be you, if that’s your thing) to follow through on crafting the product down to the last pixel.</p>

<p>Because of the bridge you build between our users and our team, patient support communities will love our products. They’ll spread the word about Human Practice, helping more people (new parents, people facing a cancer diagnosis, parents of children with autism, etc.) find good doctors.</p>

<p>Hospitals will move more quickly to deploy our solutions organization wide to improve their patient experience and to spread the word about the unique people delivering care in their organizations. Your work will lead to healthcare design awards, leaving everyone wondering why no one ever thought to build such a great service sooner.</p>

<p>In parallel, you will help us to integrate design into all aspects of Human Practice: Our design direction should align with our values, mission, business and culture. Design thinking will have an impact on our working space, how we sell, and how we hire and grow.</p>

<p>In short, you will rock our world as we enter the next chapter of our growth, and we will be so happy to be working together!</p>
