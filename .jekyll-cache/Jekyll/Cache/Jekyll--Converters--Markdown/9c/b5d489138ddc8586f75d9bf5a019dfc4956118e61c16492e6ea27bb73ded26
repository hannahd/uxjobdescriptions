I"¡<p>Our guiding principle is that by helping our users we help our business. As a designer in our Front End team youâ€™ll be a key part of the idea generation process, working in a small startup-like group which takes full ownership of their part of our platform. Youâ€™ll work with developers, product owners, copywriters and user researchers to conceive, analyse, hand code &amp; test your ideas.</p>

<p>About You
â€˜Designerâ€™ is just what it says on your CV - youâ€™d be just as happy to be labeled an Engineer, or Analyst; a Builder, Hacker or Maker. Because what you really do, what you live for, is solving problems. Your portfolio isnâ€™t a series of beautiful but generic templates - itâ€™s a collection of stories that you can discuss with enthusiasm, and regret â€¦ because youâ€™re always getting better at what you do and youâ€™re never satisfied with â€˜good enough.â€™. Youâ€™re equally comfortable discussing colour theory, user psychology, or the semantic implications of the DIV tag, youâ€™re a writer of excellent HTML &amp; CSS. Youâ€™re excited about the endless potential of the web, and being able to build things that millions of people can use every day.</p>
