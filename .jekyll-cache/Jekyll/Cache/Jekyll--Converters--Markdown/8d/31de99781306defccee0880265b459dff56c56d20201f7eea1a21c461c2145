We are growing the team across all functions to support aggressive expansion and innovation. We are looking for an energetic, innovative, and customer-obsessed Senior UX Designer with a strong visual design portfolio to deliver a product that is deceptively simple yet will change the way people shop.<br />
As UX Designer, you will be responsible for developing best-in-class consumer experiences (user interface designs, interaction models, prototypes, etc.) in a fast-paced, agile, startup-like environment. You will work closely with engineering, product/program management, marketing and site merchandising, and company leaders to successfully go from early-stage product concepts to launch. You are a pragmatic visionary that can translate business needs into a fantastic customer-focused solution. You must be responsive, flexible, and able to succeed within an open and collaborative peer environment. The ideal candidate for this position will be at ease visualizing an experience in the abstract and driving that vision into solid design deliverables. Flexibility, a strong work ethic and a good sense of humor are a must.</p>
