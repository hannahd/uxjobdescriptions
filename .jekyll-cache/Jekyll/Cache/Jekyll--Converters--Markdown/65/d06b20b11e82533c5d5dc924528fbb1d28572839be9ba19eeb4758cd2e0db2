I"w<p>Seriously collaborative, even with people not on our teams
Work on the next generation of applications for mobile devices and new/emerging technology (your work will go live in the manufacturer application stores and be seen by millions!)
Daily product decision making and real product delivery with product managers and developers
Freedom to try out new design processes; in the spirit of agile, do what works, try new things, stop doing things that don’t work; not a lot of constraints on the “creative” process
Environment that encourages learning and growing as a professional and individual; and infrastructure to support and motivate those goals
Community-oriented design team
All the designers have different skillsets: you’re not expected to be an expert in everything but having access to someone who probably is means we all get smarter by teaching and learning</p>
