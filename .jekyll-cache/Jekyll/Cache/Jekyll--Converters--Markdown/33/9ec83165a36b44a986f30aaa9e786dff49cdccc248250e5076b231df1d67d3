I"<p>Atlassian values: We deeply believe in the Atlassian values. You’ll be surprised by how important these are, and by how often they will be quoted to you.<br />
Do your homework: When you work on something, it’s up to you to do the research. You need to be able to look at competitors, talk to people in the company, talk to our users and to people who’ve never heard of us before. All the time.<br />
Gut: At some point, you will be faced with decisions, and no amount of research will be able to help you. At such points, we believe it is absolutely valid to trust your gut. <br />
Simplify: We work on tools, and the best tools are simple. It doesn’t mean that they have to be boring, but they have to be easy to grasp and easy to use. So design, then simplify, and then simplify some more.<br />
Everybody can design: We do not have a monopoly on design, and we act accordingly. Many in Atlassian have a great sense of design, and instead of trying to beat them into submission, we educate them to be able to make better decisions for themselves. <br />
You make the call, you own it: If you feel a decision needs to be made, make it, and then see where it takes you. It’s important that you then own the decision and monitor it, and admit failure as enthusiastically as you claim victory.</p>
