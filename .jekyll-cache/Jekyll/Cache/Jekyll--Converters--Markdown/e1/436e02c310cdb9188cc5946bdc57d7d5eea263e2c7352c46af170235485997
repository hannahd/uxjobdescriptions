We are looking for a Sr. UX Designer to use empirical observations and data to design a successful and memorable experience. The right candidate has enough experience and training in interaction design not just to advocate for the right decision but to know how they might be wrong. They are comfortable working closely with cross-functional teams to design not only high-level interactions but also corner and error cases. They design pages not as static presentations of information but as living spaces for interaction.</p>
