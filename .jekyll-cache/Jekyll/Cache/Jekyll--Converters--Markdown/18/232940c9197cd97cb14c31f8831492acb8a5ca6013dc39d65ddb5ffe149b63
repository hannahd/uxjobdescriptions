I"ª<p>Thoughtfulness-Youâ€™re thoughtful and deliberate in your choices and able to articulate that on the fly across a cross-functional team, and occasionally, conflicting priorities and objectives. <br />
â€¢   Sales intelligence + persuasion skills-Youâ€™ve got the social intelligence and sales skills to understand (or explain) what needs to be changed, and why. You use criticism to spur insightful conversations, not a reason to be defensive or shut down.
â€¢   A translator of tradeoffs-Thereâ€™s no perfect interface and no right answer. Youâ€™re able to create different options and translate the tradeoffs between them in the context of business objectives. <br />
  A facilitator-You know how to collaborate with others and let them put their concerns on the table.
A strong portfolio is absolutely critical for this role, both in terms of demonstrating your experience and as an example of your ability to create a compelling design presentation. Showcase your experience in UX and interaction design, particularly where simplicity and ease of use were a major concern. Weâ€™d like to see a diversity of projects, but be careful that your portfolio doesnâ€™t get scattered or overly long-focus on curation and quality to choose a solid collection of outcomes and design intermediaries and deliverables (especially flows, mockups, and prototypes), and be sure the portfolio demonstrates the design and thought process behind each image.</p>
