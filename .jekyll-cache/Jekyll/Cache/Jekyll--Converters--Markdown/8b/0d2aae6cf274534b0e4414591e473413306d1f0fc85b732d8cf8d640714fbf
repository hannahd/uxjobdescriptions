I")<p>We’re looking for an Senior UX/UI Designer to help us reimagine and redesign the next generation of iRise software. We want someone who’s passionate about taking on big design challenges. How can we make it even easier for non-designers to build interactive prototypes? How can we support powerful logic and complex interactions while keeping the product simple? You’ll have to ask tough questions, challenge the status quo, conduct new research, and translate it all into simple, beautiful, and detailed designs that customers love.<br /></p>
