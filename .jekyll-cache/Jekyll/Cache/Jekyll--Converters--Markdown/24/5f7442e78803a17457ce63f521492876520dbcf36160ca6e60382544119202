I"\<p>Come join Bing UX, where we have been reimagining the way people see and interact with search for the last 5 years. Weâ€™re on a mission to reset expectations about how search looks, acts, and sounds. To make it visually distinct. To deliver it wherever people need it. And to support them as they strive to know more, do more, and be more.</p>
