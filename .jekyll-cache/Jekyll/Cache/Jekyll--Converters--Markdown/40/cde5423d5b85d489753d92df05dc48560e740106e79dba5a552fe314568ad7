I"î<p>Extensive experience building and optimizing online consumer-facing products. Customers interact with your products without realizing it, because youâ€™ve streamlined the process in intuitive ways. You obsess over user experience and inspire the team to execute your vision.<br />
Experience prioritizing projects deemed critical across the entire organization. Everyone thinks their need is the #1 concern, but you know how to manage all of these top priorities across teams competing for the same resources.<br />
A burning desire to dig into the data. You make decisions based on rigorous analysis of metrics and your team has confidence in your recommendations because of your detailed analysis. Youâ€™re a data nerd, and proud of it.<br />
A willingness to fail-fast. Not that your goal is to fail, but you recognize when things are going awry, and make course corrections quickly. You acknowledge your findings publicly, and the organization respects your honesty and ability to learn from previous attempts.<br />
A genuine need to Get Things Done. You move quickly, you push the team, you execute at a high level. No one ever wonders if youâ€™re on top of things, because youâ€™ve already responded to the crisis before anyone else knew about it.</p>
