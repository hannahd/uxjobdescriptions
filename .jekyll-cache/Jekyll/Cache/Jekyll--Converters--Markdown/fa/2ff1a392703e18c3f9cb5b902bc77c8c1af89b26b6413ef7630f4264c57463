I"_<p>At Microsoft Studios we want to positively impact the world, improve people’s lives, and delight our customers. We want to discover (and ship) new experiences that revolutionize the entertainment industry!
It’s not just about games any more. We are looking to push the boundaries of a larger playground. The Technology and Incubation team is part of a group chartered to revolutionize entertainment content. This group most recently helped drive and ship the award-winning Kinect, including creation of several of the launch titles.
Excited yet?   Fantastic!   We currently have need of exceptional candidates to help us in achieving our goals.   We are looking for an experienced creative individual who can help us bring Microsoft’s next big IP to life. We’re looking for a designer with strong user interface, interaction and usability skills who can design intuitive, engaging interaction models for our entertainment experiences. From creating wireframes and prototypes to engaging with our user research team to iterating on the final product, you will work on the user experience from end-to-end.</p>
